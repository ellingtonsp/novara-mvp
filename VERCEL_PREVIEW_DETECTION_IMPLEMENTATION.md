# Vercel Preview URL Detection - Implementation Summary

## ‚úÖ Status: IMPLEMENTED

**Date:** January 2025  
**Scope:** Frontend environment detection enhancement  
**Files Modified:** `frontend/src/lib/environment.ts`, `docs/railway-vercel-integration-guide.md`

## Problem Solved

Previously, the project couldn't automatically detect Vercel preview deployments (branch pushes, PRs). This led to manual environment management for preview URLs.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Automatic Vercel Environment Detection
- **Primary:** Uses Vercel's `VITE_VERCEL_ENV` for automatic environment detection
- **Fallback:** Hostname-based detection for `.vercel.app` domains
- **Backward Compatible:** Maintains existing staging and development detection

### 2. Enhanced Environment Configuration

```typescript
// New environment types supported:
- 'development' ‚Üí http://localhost:9002
- 'staging' ‚Üí https://novara-staging-staging.up.railway.app  
- 'preview' ‚Üí https://novara-staging-staging.up.railway.app (NEW)
- 'production' ‚Üí https://novara-mvp-production.up.railway.app
```

### 3. Enhanced Debugging
- Preview deployments now show comprehensive environment info in console
- Includes Vercel-specific variables for troubleshooting
- Logging enabled for staging, preview, and development environments

## Configuration Status

**‚úÖ ALREADY CONFIGURED:** System environment variables are enabled in Vercel Dashboard

Vercel is already providing the required environment variables:

This provides variables like:
- `VITE_VERCEL_ENV` (production/preview/development)
- `VITE_VERCEL_URL` (current deployment URL)
- `VITE_VERCEL_BRANCH_URL` (branch-specific URL)
- `VITE_VERCEL_GIT_COMMIT_REF` (branch name)

## Testing

### Preview Deployment Test
1. Create a feature branch
2. Push changes to trigger Vercel preview deployment
3. Check browser console for environment detection:
   ```javascript
   üåç Environment Configuration: {
     environment: "preview",
     viteVercelEnv: "preview",
     viteVercelUrl: "novara-mvp-git-feature-branch.vercel.app"
   }
   ```

### API Connection Test
- Preview deployments should connect to staging Railway backend
- Verify API calls work correctly in preview environment

## Benefits

- ‚úÖ **Zero Manual Configuration:** Preview URLs automatically detected
- ‚úÖ **Branch-Specific Environment:** Each PR gets proper environment context
- ‚úÖ **Enhanced Debugging:** Better visibility into environment detection
- ‚úÖ **Backward Compatible:** Existing production/staging workflows unchanged
- ‚úÖ **Performance:** Maintains direct Railway API calls (no proxy overhead)

## Architecture Decision

**Choice:** Enhanced Option 2 (Direct Railway Calls + Auto Detection)  
**Reasoning:** 
- Keeps production-ready direct API architecture
- Adds automatic preview detection without complexity
- Maintains team's familiar patterns and debugging workflows
- No performance overhead from proxy layer
