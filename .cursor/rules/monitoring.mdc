# Monitoring & Observability

## Health Checks
- **Environment Health**: `npm run health-check`
- **Schema Validation**: `npm run validate-schema-comprehensive`
- **Performance Monitoring**: `npm run performance`
- **Deployment Tracking**: `npm run track:deployments`
- **ðŸ“– Monitoring Guide**: `docs/deployment-monitoring-guide.md` - Comprehensive monitoring setup
- **ðŸ“– Railway Health**: `docs/railway-health-check-guide.md` - Railway-specific health monitoring

## Key Metrics to Monitor
- API response times
- Authentication success rates
- Database connection health
- Deployment success rates
- Error rates by environment

## Alerting & Notifications
- **Performance alerts**: Response time thresholds
- **Error rate alerts**: 5xx error percentage
- **Deployment alerts**: Success/failure notifications
- **Health check alerts**: Service availability

## Monitoring Tools
- **Railway monitoring**: Built-in health checks and logs
- **Vercel monitoring**: Frontend performance and errors
- **Sentry**: Error tracking and performance monitoring
- **Custom scripts**: Environment-specific monitoring

## Performance Monitoring
- **Response time tracking**: API endpoint performance
- **Database query optimization**: Slow query detection
- **Frontend performance**: Bundle size and load times
- **User experience metrics**: Page load times and interactions

## Troubleshooting
- **Health check failures**: Check service status and logs
- **Performance issues**: Monitor response times and resource usage
- **Deployment failures**: Review deployment logs and rollback procedures
- **Error tracking**: Use Sentry for detailed error analysis
