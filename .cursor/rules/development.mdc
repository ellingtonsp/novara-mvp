# Development Workflow

## Local Development Setup
- **Use stable ports**: Frontend 4200, Backend 9002
- **Avoid conflict ports**: 3000, 3001, 3002 (high conflict rate)
- **Use SQLite for local database**

## Key Commands
```bash
# Start stable development environment
./scripts/start-dev-stable.sh

# Run tests (non-hanging)
npm test
npm run test:fast
npm run test:full

# Health checks
npm run health-check
npm run performance

# BugBot validation
npm run bugbot:local        # Check environment before development
npm run bugbot:pre-deploy   # Validate before deployment
npm run bugbot:post-deploy  # Validate after deployment
```

## Port Strategy
- **Frontend**: 4200 (stable, <5% conflict)
- **Backend**: 9002 (stable, <5% conflict)
- **Avoid**: 3000-3002 (90% conflict probability)

## Testing Guidelines
- Use timeouts to prevent hanging tests
- Mock external services in tests
- Test both frontend and backend components
- Validate environment configurations

## Development Best Practices
- Always use stable port strategy
- Document all changes
- Test locally before committing
- Follow established branching strategy
- Run BugBot validation before and after deployments
- Check generated BugBot reports for issues
- Address BugBot-identified errors before proceeding
