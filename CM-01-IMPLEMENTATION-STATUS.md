## 🔧 Technical Implementation Details

### Sentiment Analysis Algorithm:
```typescript
// VADER-based with IVF-specific enhancements
const POSITIVE_WORDS = {
  amazing: 2.2, blessed: 2.2, miracle: 2.4, 
  journey: 1.2, progress: 1.8, support: 1.6,
  // ... 50+ fertility-specific positive terms
};

// Thresholds: positive > 0.5, negative < -0.05, else neutral
if (compound >= 0.5) sentiment = 'positive';
else if (compound <= -0.05) sentiment = 'negative';
else sentiment = 'neutral';
```

### Database Schema:
```sql
-- Sentiment fields added to daily_checkins table
sentiment TEXT,                    -- 'positive'|'neutral'|'negative'
sentiment_confidence REAL,         -- 0.0-1.0
sentiment_scores TEXT,             -- JSON VADER scores
sentiment_processing_time INTEGER  -- milliseconds
```

### Analytics Event:
```javascript
{
  user_id: "rec1753309766266nhq0zhorb",
  sentiment: "positive",
  confidence: 0.85,
  mood_score: 9,
  processing_time_ms: 0.01,
  text_sources: ["user_note", "mood_selection"],
  sentiment_scores: { positive: 0.85, neutral: 0.15, negative: 0, compound: 0.85 }
}
```

## 🚨 Known Issues & Limitations

### Minor Issues:
1. **Negation handling**: "Not feeling good" classified as neutral (should be negative) - minor edge case
2. **Precision gap**: 80% vs 85% target for positive sentiment - **FIXED** with threshold adjustment
3. **Generic message bug**: Daily insights not using sentiment analysis - **FIXED** with sentiment-based copy variants

### Limitations:
1. **Sarcasm detection**: Limited ability to detect sarcastic positive statements
2. **Context awareness**: Doesn't consider broader conversation context
3. **Cultural nuances**: May not capture cultural-specific positive expressions

### Mitigation Strategies:
- ✅ **Confidence thresholds**: Higher confidence required for celebration trigger
- ✅ **Fallback handling**: Neutral sentiment when analysis is uncertain
- 🔄 **Future**: User feedback button for sentiment correction
