# ON-01 Baseline Panel Dismissal Fix Test

## Issue Fixed
When users dismiss the baseline panel before completion, they were left in an incomplete state with incorrect messaging.

## Fix Applied
1. **Added dismissal tracking** - `baselineDismissed` state
2. **Replaced alert with proper UI** - Warning card with re-trigger button
3. **Conditional check-in form** - Shows warning instead of normal form when dismissed
4. **Reset state on completion** - Clears dismissal state when baseline is completed

## Test Scenarios

### 1. Dismiss Baseline Panel Early
**Steps:**
1. Complete fast onboarding (3 questions)
2. Click "Continue to Dashboard"
3. Baseline panel appears
4. Click the "X" button to dismiss
5. **Expected:** Warning card appears instead of check-in form

**Expected Result:**
- âœ… Yellow warning card with "Complete Your Profile Setup" message
- âœ… "Complete Profile Setup" button to re-trigger baseline panel
- âœ… No normal check-in form visible
- âœ… Daily insights still show "Complete your profile to unlock personalized insights"

### 2. Re-trigger Baseline Panel
**Steps:**
1. After dismissing baseline panel (from scenario 1)
2. Click "Complete Profile Setup" button
3. **Expected:** Baseline panel re-appears

**Expected Result:**
- âœ… Baseline panel modal appears
- âœ… User can complete the remaining questions
- âœ… After completion, normal dashboard appears

### 3. Complete Baseline Panel
**Steps:**
1. Complete fast onboarding
2. Complete baseline panel (all 5 questions)
3. **Expected:** Normal dashboard with check-in form

**Expected Result:**

- âœ… Normal check-in form appears
- âœ… Daily insights work normally
- âœ… `baselineDismissed` state is reset

### 4. Mobile Dismissal
**Steps:**
1. Test on mobile view
2. Dismiss baseline panel
3. **Expected:** Mobile-optimized warning card

**Expected Result:**
- âœ… Smaller warning card appropriate for mobile
