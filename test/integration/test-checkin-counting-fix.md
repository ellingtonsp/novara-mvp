## 🎯 Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Verify Check-in Submission Still Works
**Objective**: Ensure check-in submission wasn't broken by our database adapter changes

**Steps**:
1. **Login to Production**: https://novara-mvp-production.up.railway.app
2. **Submit a Check-in**:
   - Select mood (e.g., "hopeful, anxious")
   - Set confidence level (e.g., 7/10)
   - Add optional concern or note
   - **Click Submit**
3. **Verify Success**: Look for success message "Daily check-in completed successfully! 🌟"

**Expected Result**: ✅ Check-in submits without errors
**Failure Signs**: ❌ Error messages, infinite loading, 500 errors

---

### Scenario 2: Verify Daily Insights Now Count Check-ins Correctly
**Objective**: Confirm the main bug is fixed - insights show actual check-in counts

**Steps**:
1. **Submit Check-in** (from Scenario 1)
2. **Refresh the Page** (or wait for insight to reload)
3. **Check Daily Insight Section** for:
   - **"Based on your data:"** section
   - **Check-in count**: Should show "1 check-in analyzed" (or higher if you have previous ones)
   - **Your actual name** in the insight (not "Monkey")

**Expected Result**: 
- ✅ Shows "1 check-ins analyzed" or higher (NOT "0 check-ins analyzed")
- ✅ Personalized insight content with your actual name
- ✅ Insight reflects the mood/confidence you just submitted

**Failure Signs**:
- ❌ Still shows "0 check-ins analyzed"
- ❌ Generic insight not reflecting your submitted data
- ❌ "Monkey" name appearing anywhere

---

### Scenario 3: Test with Multiple Check-ins
**Objective**: Verify counting works correctly with multiple submissions

**Steps**:
1. **Submit 2-3 more check-ins** over a few minutes:
   - Use different moods (e.g., "excited", "nervous", "grateful")
   - Use different confidence levels (e.g., 4, 8, 6)
2. **Refresh insights after each submission**
3. **Observe the count incrementing**: "2 check-ins analyzed", "3 check-ins analyzed", etc.

**Expected Result**: 
- ✅ Count increases with each submission
- ✅ Insights become more personalized with more data
- ✅ Recent submissions reflected in analysis

**Failure Signs**:
- ❌ Count stays at 1 or 0 despite multiple submissions
- ❌ Insights don't reflect recent mood changes

---

### Scenario 4: Cross-Platform Verification
**Objective**: Ensure fix works across different devices/browsers

**Steps**:
1. **Test on mobile browser** (if available)
2. **Test on different browser** (Chrome, Safari, Firefox)
3. **Verify same user sees consistent check-in counts** across platforms

**Expected Result**: ✅ Consistent experience across all platforms
**Failure Signs**: ❌ Different counts on different devices

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### If Still Showing "0 check-ins analyzed"
1. **Clear browser cache** and reload
2. **Wait 30 seconds** after submission (database synchronization)
3. **Try submitting another check-in** to trigger refresh
4. **Check browser console** for any error messages

### If Seeing "Monkey" Name
1. **Clear browser localStorage**: `localStorage.clear()` in console
2. **Re-login** to refresh authentication token
3. **Report immediately** - this indicates the auth fallback bug returned
