4. Monitor console for event

**Expected Results**:
- Console shows: `📊 PH-DEV Event: insight_viewed {user_id: "u_123", insight_id: "insight_confidence_rising_1234567890", insight_type: "confidence_rising", dwell_ms: 0, environment: "development", timestamp: "..."}`
- Event fires when IntersectionObserver triggers
- Only fires once per insight

**Validation Checklist**:
- [ ] Event name: `insight_viewed`
- [ ] Required props: `user_id`, `insight_id`, `insight_type`
- [ ] Optional props: `dwell_ms`
- [ ] IntersectionObserver threshold: 50%
- [ ] Single fire per insight

### 4. Share Action Event Tracking (Future) ⏳

**Objective**: Verify share event fires when share functionality is implemented

**Steps**:
1. TBD - Share functionality not yet implemented
2. When implemented, test share buttons
3. Monitor console for events

**Expected Results**:
- Console shows: `📊 PH-DEV Event: share_action {user_id: "u_123", share_surface: "insight", destination: "whatsapp", environment: "development", timestamp: "..."}`

**Validation Checklist**:
- [ ] Event name: `share_action`
- [ ] Required props: `user_id`, `share_surface`, `destination`
- [ ] Optional props: `content_id`

## Performance & Reliability Tests

### 5. Event Timing Performance ✅

**Objective**: Verify events fire within 200ms with zero UX lag

**Steps**:
1. Open browser dev tools → Performance tab
2. Start recording
3. Perform signup action
4. Stop recording and analyze

**Expected Results**:
- Event tracking adds <200ms to user actions
- No visible lag or UI freezing
- PostHog initialization completes before first event

**Validation Checklist**:
- [ ] Event timing: <200ms
- [ ] No UI blocking
- [ ] Smooth user experience

### 6. Environment Handling ✅

**Objective**: Verify proper environment-specific behavior

**Steps**:
1. Test in development mode
2. Test in staging mode
3. Test in production mode

**Expected Results**:
- **Development**: Events logged to console only
- **Staging**: Events sent to PostHog with debug logging
- **Production**: Events sent to PostHog with minimal logging

**Validation Checklist**:
- [ ] Development: console.debug only
- [ ] Staging: PostHog + debug logs
- [ ] Production: PostHog + minimal logs

---

### 7. Error Handling ✅

**Objective**: Verify graceful error handling
