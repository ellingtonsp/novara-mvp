# 🔧 Vercel Blank Page Fix

## 🚨 **Issue Identified**
Your Vercel pages were showing blank because the JavaScript assets were not being served correctly.

## 🔍 **Root Cause**
The problem was in the `vercel.json` configuration. The catch-all route `"/(.*)"` was redirecting ALL requests (including asset requests) to `index.html`, which meant:

- ✅ HTML was loading correctly
- ❌ JavaScript files were being served as HTML instead of JavaScript
- ❌ CSS files were being served as HTML instead of CSS
- ❌ React app couldn't initialize, causing blank pages

## 🛠️ **The Fix**

### **Before (Problematic Configuration):**
```json
{
  "routes": [
    {
      "src": "/(.*)",
      "dest": "/index.html"
    }
  ]
}
```

### **After (Fixed Configuration):**
```json
{
  "routes": [
    {
      "src": "/assets/(.*)",
      "dest": "/assets/$1"
    },
    {
      "src": "/vite.svg",
      "dest": "/vite.svg"
    },
    {
      "src": "/(.*)",
      "dest": "/index.html"
    }
  ]
}
```

## ✅ **What the Fix Does**

1. **Static Assets Route**: `/assets/(.*)` → `/assets/$1`
   - Serves JavaScript, CSS, and other assets correctly
   - Maintains proper content-type headers

2. **Icon Route**: `/vite.svg` → `/vite.svg`
   - Serves the favicon correctly

3. **SPA Route**: `/(.*)` → `/index.html`
   - Handles React Router navigation
   - Serves the main app for all other routes
