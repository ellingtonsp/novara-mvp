# ON-01 Baseline Panel Fix Test

## 🚨 **Issue Fixed**
Fast Lane users were seeing insights and check-in forms before completing the Baseline Panel, violating the ON-01 specification.

## ✅ **Changes Made**

### **1. Conditional Insights Display**
- **Mobile**: `DailyInsightsDisplay` only shows if `!needsBaselineCompletion(user, onboardingPath)`
- **Desktop**: `DailyInsightsDisplay` only shows if `!needsBaselineCompletion(user, onboardingPath)`

### **2. Conditional Check-in Forms**
- **Mobile**: Quick action cards hidden for incomplete baseline users
- **Desktop**: `DailyCheckinForm` only shows if `!needsBaselineCompletion(user, onboardingPath)`

### **3. Baseline Completion Prompt**
- **Mobile**: Shows "Complete Your Profile" card with button to trigger Baseline Panel
- **Desktop**: Shows "Complete Your Profile" section with button to trigger Baseline Panel

### **4. Baseline Panel Integration**
- **Mobile**: Already had Baseline Panel modal
- **Desktop**: Added Baseline Panel modal to desktop view

## 🧪 **Test Steps**

### **Test 1: Fast Lane User (Test Path)**
```bash
# Set environment
export VITE_FORCE_ONBOARDING_PATH=test
export VITE_DEBUG_AB_TEST=true

# Expected Flow
1. Complete Fast Lane onboarding (3 questions)
2. Land on dashboard
3. Should see "Complete Your Profile" message
4. Should NOT see insights or check-in forms
5. Click "Complete Profile" → Baseline Panel appears
6. Complete Baseline Panel → Insights and check-in forms appear
```

### **Test 2: Control User (Control Path)**
```bash
# Set environment
export VITE_FORCE_ONBOARDING_PATH=control
export VITE_DEBUG_AB_TEST=true

# Expected Flow
1. Complete full onboarding (6 questions)
2. Land on dashboard
3. Should see insights and check-in forms immediately
4. Should NOT see "Complete Your Profile" message
```

## 🔍 **Verification Points**
