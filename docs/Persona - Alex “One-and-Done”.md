| Attribute                | Detail                                                     |
|--------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Age / Life Stage**     | 30 yrs – 2nd IVF cycle, juggling a full-time sales job     |
| **Location**             | Suburban Texas                                            |
| **Career & Tech**        | Heavy phone multitasker; lives in Slack & Gmail            |
| **Primary Goal**         | “Fast answers, minimal extra work.”                        |
| **Behavior Pattern**     | Signs up, skims onboarding, logs *one* check-in, then disappears |
| **Reasons for Drop-off** | • Doesn’t perceive immediate value (“Just another mood tracker”)<br>• Inbox/push overload – onboarding email buried<br>• No clear tie-back to medical success metrics |
| **Internal Objections**  | • “If this can’t shave clinic visits or save $$, why invest time?”<br>• Privacy worries (no clear HIPAA signals) |
| **Rescue Opportunities** | • Trigger same-day “We noticed you’re busy—here’s the 30-sec fast lane” nudge<br>• Surface concrete IVF success-rate stat tied to engagement (“Users who log 5× see 15 % higher adherence”) |
| **Churn Signal**         | No activity within first 48 h **and** onboarding email unopened |
| **Success Metric (Re-engage)** | Returns within 7 days and completes ≥3 check-ins the following week |
