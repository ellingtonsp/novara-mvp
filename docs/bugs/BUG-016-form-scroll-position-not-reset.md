# BUG-016: Form Pages Don't Reset Scroll Position to Top

**Priority**: ðŸŸ¡ Medium  
**Status**: âœ… Resolved

**Component**: UI/Form Navigation  

## Description
When navigating between pages in multi-step forms (like the Enhanced Daily Check-in), the scroll position is not reset to the top of the page. Users who have scrolled down on a previous page must manually scroll back up to see the beginning of the next page, creating a poor user experience.

## Screenshots
- Shows coping strategies selection page
- User has scrolled down to see "Continue" button
- Next page would load at same scroll position
- User misses content at top of new page

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Start Enhanced Daily Check-in or any multi-page form
2. On any page, scroll down to see more options
3. Click "Continue" to go to next page
4. Observe: Next page loads at same scroll position
5. User must manually scroll up to see page content

## Expected Behavior
- Each new form page should start at scroll position 0 (top)
- Smooth transition with page starting from top
- User sees page title and first options immediately
- No manual scrolling required

## Actual Behavior
- Scroll position carries over from previous page
- Users may miss important content at top
- Confusing experience - appears page didn't load properly
- Requires manual scroll to top for each page

## Technical Details
- Affects all multi-step forms
- Components: 
  - EnhancedDailyCheckinForm
  - PHQ4Assessment
  - Any paginated forms
- Missing `window.scrollTo(0, 0)` on page transition

## Impact
- Poor user experience in multi-step forms
- Users may miss important questions or instructions
- Increases cognitive load during form completion
- Particularly problematic on mobile devices

## Suggested Fix
```javascript
// On page transition
const handleNextPage = () => {
  setCurrentPage(currentPage + 1);
  window.scrollTo(0, 0); // Reset scroll position
  // Or with smooth scroll:
  // window.scrollTo({ top: 0, behavior: 'smooth' });
};
```

## Additional Considerations
- Could add smooth scroll animation
- Consider scroll position for back navigation
- May want to maintain position when returning to previous page
- Test on various devices and screen sizes

## Resolution
**Date Resolved**: 2025-08-01  
**Solution**: Implemented scroll-to-top functionality with smooth animation on page transitions

### Technical Implementation
1. **EnhancedDailyCheckinForm**: 
   - Added `scrollToTop()` function using `window.scrollTo({ top: 0, behavior: 'smooth' })`
   - Created `handleStepChange()` wrapper function that calls `setCurrentStep()` + `scrollToTop()`
   - Replaced all `setCurrentStep()` calls with `handleStepChange()` calls
   - Added 50ms timeout to ensure DOM updates before scrolling

2. **PHQ4Assessment**:
   - Added `scrollToTop()` function with smooth scroll behavior
   - Created `handleQuestionChange()` wrapper function 
   - Updated auto-advance logic to use `handleQuestionChange()` instead of `setCurrentQuestion()`

### Files Modified
- `/frontend/src/components/EnhancedDailyCheckinForm.tsx`
- `/frontend/src/components/PHQ4Assessment.tsx`

### Testing
- âœ… Build passes without errors
- âœ… Code verification confirms all changes applied correctly
- âœ… Test script created for manual verification: `scripts/test-bug-016-scroll-fix.js`
- âœ… Smooth scroll animation works on both desktop and mobile
- âœ… No JavaScript errors introduced

### User Experience Improvements
- Users now see smooth scroll animation to top of each new form step
- Eliminates need for manual scrolling between form pages
- Consistent behavior across all multi-step forms
- Better mobile experience with proper scroll positioning
