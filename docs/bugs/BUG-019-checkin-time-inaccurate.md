# BUG-019: Check-in Completion Time Shows Incorrect Time

**Priority**: ðŸŸ¡ Medium  
**Status**: âœ… Resolved  
**Reported**: 2025-08-01  
**Reporter**: @stephen  
**Component**: Check-in Confirmation/Data Display  

## Description
The check-in completion confirmation screen displays an inaccurate time for when the check-in was completed. Shows "Checked in at 5:00 PM" which appears to be a hardcoded or incorrectly calculated time rather than the actual completion time. Other fields (mood, confidence) should also be verified for accuracy.

## Screenshots
- Shows "Today's Check-in Complete!" screen
- Displays "Checked in at 5:00 PM" (likely incorrect)
- Shows Mood: hopeful, Confidence: 5/10

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Complete a daily check-in at any time (not 5:00 PM)
2. View the completion confirmation screen
3. Note the displayed check-in time
4. Observe it shows "5:00 PM" regardless of actual time
5. Verify if mood and confidence values are correct

## Expected Behavior
- Display actual check-in completion time
- Format: "Checked in at [actual time]"
- Use user's timezone for display
- All fields should show data from just-completed check-in
- Example: "Checked in at 2:47 PM" if completed at 2:47

## Actual Behavior
- Shows fixed "5:00 PM" time
- May be placeholder or default value
- Doesn't reflect actual completion time
- Other fields need verification

## Technical Details
- Component: TodaysCheckinStatus or similar
- Issues to check:
  - Timestamp not being captured on submission
  - Hardcoded display value
  - Timezone conversion problems
  - Data not properly passed to confirmation screen

## Fields to Verify
1. **Check-in Time**: Currently showing incorrect time
2. **Mood**: Verify matches selected mood
3. **Confidence**: Verify matches selected confidence level
4. **Medication status**: Not shown but should be?

## Impact
- Misleading information about check-in timing
- Reduces trust in data accuracy
- May affect tracking/insights if time is wrong
- Could impact reminder systems

## Suggested Fix
```javascript
// Capture actual submission time
const completedAt = new Date();
const formattedTime = completedAt.toLocaleTimeString('en-US', {
  hour: 'numeric',
  minute: '2-digit',
  hour12: true
});

// Display: "Checked in at 2:47 PM"
```

## Additional Checks Needed
1. Verify mood emoji and text match selection
2. Confirm confidence score is accurate
3. Check if medication data should be shown
4. Ensure timezone handling is correct
5. Test with different check-in times

## Related Issues
- Data accuracy across the app
- Timezone handling consistency
- May affect daily insights if time is wrong

## Resolution
**Fixed**: 2025-08-01
**Verified**: Confirmed working in local environment

### Solution:
Updated frontend to use `created_at` field instead of `date_submitted` for displaying check-in time.

### Changes Made:
- Modified `NovaraLanding.tsx` to pass `todaysCheckin.created_at || todaysCheckin.date_submitted` to the `TodaysCheckinStatus` component
- The `created_at` field contains the full timestamp with time information, while `date_submitted` only contains the date
- Fallback to `date_submitted` maintains backward compatibility

### Verification:
- âœ… Build passes without errors
- âœ… Tested in local environment - displays correct check-in time
- âœ… No breaking changes to existing functionality
