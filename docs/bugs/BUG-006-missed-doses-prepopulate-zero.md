# BUG-006: Missed Doses Field Pre-populates with Zero

**Priority**: ðŸŸ¢ Small  
**Status**: âœ… Resolved  
**Reported**: 2025-08-01  
**Reporter**: @stephen  
**Component**: UI/UX - Enhanced Daily Check-in Form  

## Description
When users select "Missed some" for medication tracking in the Enhanced Daily Check-in form, the "How many doses missed?" field pre-populates with "0", which is contradictory and confusing since they just indicated they missed doses.

## Screenshots
- Shows "How many doses missed?" field with "0" pre-filled
- User has selected "Missed some" option

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Navigate to Enhanced Daily Check-in form
2. In Medication Tracking section, select "Missed some"
3. Observe the "How many doses missed?" field appears
4. Note that it's pre-populated with "0"

## Expected Behavior
- Field should appear blank/empty when "Missed some" is selected
- Should show placeholder text (e.g., "Enter number")
- When tapped, should bring up numeric keyboard
- Should accept null/empty value until user enters a number
- Minimum value should be 1 (since they selected "Missed some")

## Actual Behavior
- Field shows "0" which contradicts the "Missed some" selection
- Confusing UX - if 0 doses missed, why select "Missed some"?
- User must clear the 0 before entering actual number

## Technical Details
- Component: Enhanced Daily Check-in form
- Field: Missed doses input
- File: `/frontend/src/components/EnhancedDailyCheckinForm.tsx`
- Input type and default value need adjustment

## Impact
- Minor UX confusion
- Could lead to incorrect data if users don't notice the 0
- Contradictory logic reduces trust in the app
- Quick fix that improves user experience

## Suggested Fix
1. Remove default value of 0 from the input field
2. Set field to empty/null when "Missed some" is selected
3. Add placeholder text: "Enter number of doses"
4. Set input type to bring up numeric keyboard on mobile
5. Add validation: minimum value = 1 when submitting
6. Consider adding helper text: "How many doses did you miss?"

## Code Considerations
```typescript
// Current (likely):
const [missedDoses, setMissedDoses] = useState(0);

// Suggested:
const [missedDoses, setMissedDoses] = useState<number | null>(null);
```

## Mobile Considerations
- Ensure numeric keyboard appears on mobile devices
- Input type should be "number" or "tel" for better mobile UX

### Solution Summary
Fixed the missed doses field pre-population issue by changing the initial state from a default value of 1 to an empty string. The field now appears blank when "Missed some" is selected, providing a more intuitive user experience.

### Technical Details of Fix
- **Component**: `EnhancedDailyCheckinForm.tsx`
- **Change**: Modified initial state from `1` to empty string (`""`)
- **Behavior**: Field now shows empty instead of "0" when "Missed some" is selected
- **Reset Logic**: Field resets to empty when switching back to "Yes, all doses"
- **User Flow**: Users see blank field that requires their input, eliminating confusion

### Files Modified
- `/frontend/src/components/EnhancedDailyCheckinForm.tsx`
  - Changed initial state for missed doses field
  - Updated state management to use empty string instead of numeric default
  - Improved user experience by removing contradictory pre-populated value

### Validation
- âœ… Field appears empty when "Missed some" is selected
- âœ… No contradictory "0" value shown
- âœ… Field resets properly when switching medication options
- âœ… Maintains proper data handling and submission
- âœ… Improved user experience and logical consistency

### Prevention Measures
- Review all form fields for appropriate default values
- Ensure initial states align with user expectations
- Consider empty/null states for conditional fields that require user input
