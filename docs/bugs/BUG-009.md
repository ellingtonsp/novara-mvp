# BUG-009: Enhanced Daily Check-in Not Registering as Completed

## Status: RESOLVED âœ…

**Reported**: 2025-07-31
**Fixed**: 2025-08-01
**Priority**: ðŸ”´ High

## Description
When users complete the Enhanced Daily Check-in (all 4 steps), the system doesn't register it as completed. Navigating away and returning to the Check-in tab shows a new check-in prompt instead of "Today's Check-in Complete!" message.

## Root Cause
The `EnhancedDailyCheckinForm` component was not calling the `onComplete()` callback after successful submission. The parent component (`CheckinTab`) relies on this callback to update the check-in state.

## Solution Applied
Added `onComplete()` call immediately after successful submission in `EnhancedDailyCheckinForm.tsx`:

```typescript
if (response.ok) {
  setShowResults(true);
  
  // Call onComplete immediately after successful submission
  // This ensures the parent component knows the checkin is complete
  if (onComplete) {
    onComplete();
  }
```

## Verification
- Created test user bug009@test.com
- Completed Enhanced Daily Check-in with all fields
- Confirmed check-in shows as completed
- Verified all Enhanced Daily Check-in fields are being stored (some in daily_checkins table, others in health_events table per V2 architecture)

## Related Issues
- PHQ-4 skip button was incorrectly advancing to Step 2, bypassing mood selection (also fixed)
- Some Enhanced Daily Check-in fields not returned in API response (stored in health_events table - added low-priority todo for V2 data retrieval investigation)
