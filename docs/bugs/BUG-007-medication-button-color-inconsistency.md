# BUG-007: Medication Button Colors Inconsistent Between Forms

**Priority**: üü¢ Small  
**Status**: ‚úÖ Resolved  
**Reported**: 2025-08-01  
**Reporter**: @stephen  
**Component**: UI/Visual Consistency - Check-in Forms  

## Description
The medication tracking buttons in the Enhanced Daily Check-in form use different colors than the Quick Daily Check-in form. The color scheme should be consistent across all check-in forms for better user experience and visual coherence.

## Screenshots
- Enhanced Daily Check-in: Shows dark gray/black buttons for "Yes, all doses" and "Missed some"
- Quick Daily Check-in: Uses different color scheme (likely green for "Yes" and yellow/orange for "Missed")

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Complete Quick Daily Check-in and note medication button colors
2. Navigate to Enhanced Daily Check-in 
3. Observe different color scheme for same medication tracking options
4. Note the visual inconsistency between forms

## Expected Behavior
- Consistent color scheme across all medication tracking buttons
- "Yes, all doses" should use positive color (e.g., green with checkmark)
- "Missed some" should use warning color (e.g., yellow/orange with warning icon)
- Visual language should be consistent throughout the app

## Actual Behavior
- Enhanced Daily Check-in uses monochrome (dark gray/black) buttons
- Quick Daily Check-in uses colored buttons
- Inconsistent visual communication for same actions
- Different user experience between forms

## Technical Details
- Components affected:
  - `/frontend/src/components/EnhancedDailyCheckinForm.tsx`
  - `/frontend/src/components/QuickDailyCheckinForm.tsx`
- Need to share button styling/components between forms

## Visual Design Requirements
Based on Quick Daily Check-in:
- "Yes, all doses": Green background with check icon (‚úì)
- "Missed some": Yellow/orange background with warning icon (‚ö†Ô∏è)
- Maintain same styling, icons, and colors across all forms

## Impact
- Visual inconsistency reduces app polish
- May confuse users switching between forms
- Breaks established visual language
- Easy fix that improves overall UX

## Suggested Fix
1. Create shared medication button component
2. Apply consistent styling from Quick Daily Check-in
3. Use same color variables/theme across forms
4. Ensure icons are consistent
5. Test visual consistency across all check-in flows

## Related Issues
- Part of larger visual consistency issues
- Related to overall design system needs
