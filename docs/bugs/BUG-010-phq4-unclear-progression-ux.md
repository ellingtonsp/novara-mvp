**Component**: UX/Form Flow - PHQ-4 Assessment  

## Description
The PHQ-4 mental health assessment form doesn't clearly indicate to users that they need to select an option before progressing. The "Continue to Daily Check-in" button appears active even when no selection is made, potentially confusing users about whether their selection was registered or if they need to click the button to proceed.

## Screenshots
- Shows PHQ-4 Question 1 of 4
- Button appears active without selection
- No visual feedback on selection

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Navigate to PHQ-4 assessment
2. View first question about anxiety
3. Note the "Continue to Daily Check-in" button appears active
4. Try to select an option
5. Unclear if selection triggers auto-advance or requires button click

## Expected Behavior
Option 1 - Auto-advance with feedback:
- Show visual feedback when option is selected
- Brief pause then auto-advance to next question
- Progress indicator updates (1 of 4 â†’ 2 of 4)

Option 2 - Manual advance:
- Button starts disabled/grayed out
- Becomes active only after selection
- Clear call-to-action to continue

Option 3 - Add skip option:
- Keep current flow but add "Skip assessment" option
- Show friendly message: "That's ok! We'll check in again in 2 weeks!"

## Actual Behavior
- Button appears active before selection
- No clear feedback on selection
- Unclear if form auto-advances or needs button click
- Users may be confused about progression

## Technical Details
- Component: PHQ4Assessment
- File: `/frontend/src/components/PHQ4Assessment.tsx`
- Need to improve interaction feedback
- Consider form UX best practices

## Impact
- User confusion about form completion
- May lead to incomplete assessments
- Could cause users to abandon PHQ-4
- Important for mental health data collection

## Suggested Solutions

### Solution 1: Disabled Button Pattern
```typescript
<button 
  disabled={!selectedOption}
  className={selectedOption ? 'active' : 'disabled'}
>
  Continue to Next Question
</button>
```

### Solution 2: Auto-advance Pattern
- Selection triggers immediate visual feedback
- 500ms delay then auto-advance
- Progress bar animation

### Solution 3: Skip Option
- Add secondary button: "Skip this assessment"
- Friendly messaging about checking in later
- Respects user choice while encouraging completion

## Additional Improvements
1. Add selection animation/highlight
2. Update button text: "Continue to Question 2" (dynamic)
3. Show progress more prominently
4. Consider adding "Save & Exit" option

## User Research Notes
- PHQ-4 is a validated clinical tool
- Completion rates are important for data quality
- Balance between encouraging completion and respecting user choice
- Clear UX improves assessment accuracy
