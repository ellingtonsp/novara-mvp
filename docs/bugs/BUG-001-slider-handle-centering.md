# BUG-001: Slider Handle Not Centered on Track

**Priority**: ðŸŸ¡ Medium  
**Status**: âœ… Resolved  
**Reported**: 2025-08-01  
**Reporter**: @stephen  
**Component**: UI/Slider Component  

## Description
The slider handles in both the full onboarding modal and regular onboarding flow are not properly centered on the slider track. The handle appears to be offset from the center of the track bar.

## Screenshots
- Full onboarding modal: Shows handle off-center at 5/10 position
- Regular onboarding: Shows handle off-center at 5/10 position

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Start local development environment (`./scripts/start-local.sh`)
2. Navigate to onboarding flow
3. Observe slider components on questions like:
   - "When you think about your IVF medications, do you feel prepared or a bit lost?"
   - "When it comes to costs and insurance, do you feel on top of things or a bit in the dark?"
4. Notice handle is not vertically centered on the track

## Expected Behavior
- Slider handle should be perfectly centered vertically on the slider track
- Handle should maintain center alignment at all positions (1-10)

## Actual Behavior
- Handle appears offset from the track center
- Visual misalignment affects UI polish

## Technical Details
- Affects: CenteredSlider component
- File location: `/frontend/src/components/CenteredSlider.tsx`
- Related styles: `/frontend/src/styles/slider.css`

## Possible Root Cause
- CSS alignment issues with the thumb element
- Possible transform or positioning calculation error
- May be related to custom slider styling overrides

## Suggested Fix
- Review slider CSS for thumb positioning
- Check for any transform properties affecting alignment
- Ensure consistent box model calculations
- Test across different browsers

## Impact
- Visual polish issue
- Affects user experience during onboarding
- No functional impact but reduces perceived quality

## Browser/Environment
- Tested on: Chrome (latest)
- Local development environment
- Frontend port: 4200

### Solution:
- Created UnifiedSlider component with proper centering logic
- Implemented "centered" variant that visually centers value 5 at 50% position
- Replaced all existing slider implementations with UnifiedSlider
- Fixed duplicate value display issues across all forms

### Technical Details:
- UnifiedSlider uses custom percentage calculation for centered variant
- Values 1-5 map to 0-50% of track, values 6-10 map to 50-100%
- Component provides consistent slider behavior across entire application
- Removed all hardcoded center markers that were causing visual artifacts
