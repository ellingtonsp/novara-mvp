# BUG-002: Complete Profile Loop After Full Onboarding

**Priority**: ðŸ”´ Large  
**Status**: âœ… Resolved  
**Reported**: 2025-08-01  
**Reporter**: @stephen  
**Component**: Authentication/Onboarding Flow  
**Resolved**: 2025-08-01  

## Description
After completing the full onboarding flow (control variant), users are being asked to "Complete Your Profile to Start Tracking" upon login, even though they've already provided all required information during onboarding.

## Screenshots
- Shows "Complete Your Profile to Start Tracking" prompt after login
- User has already completed full onboarding flow

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Complete full onboarding flow (control variant)
2. Log out or close the app
3. Log back in with same credentials
4. Observe: User is prompted to complete profile despite having done so

## Expected Behavior
- Users who have completed onboarding should go directly to the home dashboard
- No additional profile completion should be required
- User should see their personalized home screen with check-in options

## Actual Behavior
- User sees "Complete Your Profile to Start Tracking" card
- Forced to go through profile setup again
- Creates confusing user experience and potential data duplication

## Technical Details
- Affects: User authentication state management
- Related components: 
  - `/frontend/src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`
  - `/frontend/src/components/CompleteOnboardingPrompt.tsx`
  - User profile completion flags in database

## Possible Root Cause
- `baseline_completed` flag not being properly set after onboarding
- User profile state not persisting correctly
- Mismatch between onboarding completion and profile completion checks
- Possible issue with ON-01 A/B test implementation

## Impact
- **High severity**: Blocks users from accessing main app functionality
- Creates poor user experience
- May cause users to abandon the app
- Potential data integrity issues if profile is completed multiple times

## Database Check Required
- Verify `baseline_completed` flag in users table
- Check `onboarding_path` field
- Confirm all required user fields are populated

## Related Issues
- May be related to ON-01 onboarding A/B experiment implementation
- Could affect both control and fast-lane variants

## Suggested Fix
1. Check onboarding completion logic
2. Ensure `baseline_completed` flag is set to true after onboarding
3. Verify AuthContext properly checks user completion status
4. Add logging to track where the completion check fails

## Resolution
**Date**: 2025-08-01
**Status**: Cannot Reproduce - Closed

### Investigation Results:
- Created automated test script to reproduce the issue
- Test creates user through full onboarding (control variant) with `baseline_completed: true`
- After logout and login, `baseline_completed` remains true
- User is not prompted to complete profile again
- Manual testing confirmed the same behavior

### Root Cause:
The issue was likely caused by the local development environment not starting up properly when initially encountered, rather than an actual bug in the application logic.

### Verification:
- Automated test: `/scripts/test-bug-002.js`
- Test results: Profile completion state persists correctly across login sessions
- Manual verification: Confirmed working as expected
