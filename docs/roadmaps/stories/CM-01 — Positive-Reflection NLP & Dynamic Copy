# CM-01  Positive-Reflection NLP & Dynamic Copy

## Epic
**E2 Insight Polish**  Make check-ins feel valuable and insights feel personalized

## Story
As a user who has good days too, I want the app to acknowledge and celebrate my positive check-ins with thoughtful responses, so I feel like Novara understands my whole health journey, not just the challenges.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. **Sentiment Detection**
   - [ ] NLP identifies positive sentiment in check-in responses
   - [ ] Recognize keywords: "great", "energetic", "happy", "better", "improved"
   - [ ] Detect positive patterns: pain reduction, mood improvement, energy increase
   - [ ] Handle mixed sentiment (good and bad in same check-in)

2. **Dynamic Response Generation**
   - [ ] Generate contextually appropriate celebratory messages
   - [ ] Vary responses to avoid repetition (minimum 20 variants)
   - [ ] Reference specific positive aspects user mentioned
   - [ ] Maintain appropriate tone (supportive, not over-the-top)

3. **Response Examples**
   - [ ] Energy: "Your energy boost is worth celebrating! <"
   - [ ] Pain: "Less pain today - your body is thanking you."
   - [ ] Mood: "Glad you're feeling brighter today!"
   - [ ] General: "Good days deserve recognition too. Nice work!"

4. **Contextual Intelligence**
   - [ ] Consider user's baseline (good day relative to their normal)
   - [ ] Acknowledge improvement trends over time
   - [ ] Don't celebrate if user indicates concern about feeling "too good"
   - [ ] Respect cultural differences in emotional expression

5. **Display & Timing**
   - [ ] Show message immediately after positive check-in
   - [ ] Include in daily insight summary
   - [ ] Optional: Weekly "wins" recap email
   - [ ] Allow users to disable if preferred

## Technical Considerations
- Implement using lightweight NLP library (e.g., Natural, Sentiment)
- Store response templates in configurable system
- A/B test different response styles
- Cache sentiment analysis for performance
- Plan for multiple language support

## NLP Training Data
- Collect anonymized positive check-ins for model training
- Include diverse expressions of wellness
- Account for condition-specific "good days"
- Regular model updates based on user feedback

## Personalization Layers
1. **Basic**: Generic positive acknowledgment
2. **Intermediate**: Reference specific symptoms/feelings mentioned
3. **Advanced**: Consider user history and progress trends
4. **Premium**: AI-generated unique responses

## Business Value
- **Retention**: Users with acknowledged good days have 35% higher retention
- **Engagement**: Positive reinforcement increases check-in frequency by 20%
- **Word-of-mouth**: Happy users 3x more likely to recommend
- **Differentiation**: Most health apps focus only on problems

## Dependencies
- NLP library selection and integration
- Response template management system
- AN-01 event tracking for effectiveness measurement
- User preference system for opt-out capability

## Definition of Done
- [ ] NLP accurately identifies 90%+ of positive sentiments
- [ ] 20+ response templates implemented and tested
- [ ] A/B test framework configured
- [ ] Performance impact < 100ms
- [ ] User feedback mechanism implemented
- [ ] Opt-out preference available in settings
- [ ] Analytics tracking response engagement

## Story Points: 3
Moderate complexity due to NLP integration and response variety requirements.
