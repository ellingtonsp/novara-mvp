# AI-01 — Actionable Insights

## Epic
**E2 Insight Polish** — Make check-ins feel valuable and insights feel personalized

## Story
As a user tracking my health daily, I want to receive AI-powered insights that analyze my patterns and provide specific actions I can take, so I can actively improve my health rather than just passively tracking it.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. **Pattern Recognition**
   - [ ] Identify correlations between symptoms, mood, and behaviors
   - [ ] Detect cyclical patterns (weekly, monthly, seasonal)
   - [ ] Recognize triggers for symptom flares or improvements
   - [ ] Surface unusual changes that deserve attention

2. **Insight Generation**
   - [ ] Generate 2-3 insights per week based on check-in data
   - [ ] Each insight must include a specific, actionable recommendation
   - [ ] Insights personalized to user's condition and goals
   - [ ] Avoid generic advice - be specific to user's patterns

3. **Insight Categories**
   - [ ] **Correlation**: "Your energy dips 2 days before rain. Plan lighter schedules."
   - [ ] **Trend**: "Sleep quality improved 30% since you started evening walks."
   - [ ] **Cycle**: "Headaches peak day 21-23 of your cycle. Consider preventive care."
   - [ ] **Optimization**: "You feel best when you check in before 9 AM."

4. **Delivery & Presentation**
   - [ ] Show insights prominently on dashboard
   - [ ] Include data visualization supporting the insight
   - [ ] Allow users to mark insights as helpful/not helpful
   - [ ] Archive insights for future reference

5. **Intelligence Requirements**
   - [ ] Minimum 7 days of data before first insight
   - [ ] Confidence threshold of 75% before showing correlation
   - [ ] Continuously improve based on user feedback
   - [ ] Never make medical diagnosis or treatment recommendations

## Technical Considerations
- Use time-series analysis for pattern detection
- Implement ML pipeline for correlation discovery
- Store insights with metadata for improvement tracking
- Plan for explainable AI - users should understand "why"
- Consider edge computing for privacy-sensitive analysis

## Actionable Insight Examples
1. **Sleep & Mood**: "You rate mood 2 points higher after 7+ hours sleep. Try a 10 PM bedtime routine."
2. **Exercise & Pain**: "Light exercise reduces next-day pain by 40%. Consider daily 15-min walks."
3. **Stress & Symptoms**: "Work stress triggers flares 85% of the time. Practice lunch break breathing."
4. **Diet & Energy**: "Afternoon energy crashes follow high-carb lunches. Try protein-focused meals."

## Business Value
- **Differentiation**: Moves beyond tracking to active health improvement
- **Retention**: Users receiving insights have 60% higher 30-day retention
- **Premium Conversion**: Actionable insights drive 25% free-to-paid conversion
- **Health Outcomes**: Users report 40% better symptom management

## ML Model Requirements
- Supervised learning for known pattern types
- Unsupervised learning for novel pattern discovery
- Feedback loop for model improvement
- Privacy-preserving federated learning option
- Regular retraining schedule (weekly)

## Dependencies
- Sufficient historical data (minimum 1000 users with 30+ days)
- Data science team or ML platform
- Visualization library for insight graphics
- AN-01 event tracking for effectiveness measurement

## Definition of Done
- [ ] ML pipeline deployed and generating insights
- [ ] 10+ insight templates with action recommendations
- [ ] Insight quality score > 4.0/5.0 from users
- [ ] Dashboard integration complete
- [ ] Feedback mechanism implemented
- [ ] A/B test showing improved retention
- [ ] Performance < 2s for insight generation

## Story Points: 5
Complex ML implementation requiring data pipeline, algorithm development, and UX integration.
