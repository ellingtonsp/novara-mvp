# Airtable Schema Test Results

## Test Date: January 29, 2025

### ✅ PASSED - Ready for Deployment

#### Enhanced DailyCheckins Fields
All evidence-based fields are now supported:
- ✅ anxiety_level
- ✅ took_all_medications
- ✅ missed_doses
- ✅ injection_confidence
- ✅ side_effects
- ✅ appointment_within_3_days
- ✅ appointment_anxiety
- ✅ coping_strategies_used
- ✅ partner_involved_today
- ✅ wish_knew_more_about

#### PHQ4Assessments Table
- ✅ Table exists and accepts data
- ✅ All fields working correctly

### ⚠️ PARTIAL - Limited Functionality

#### FVMAnalytics Table
- ❌ Table does not exist
- **Impact**: A/B testing metrics and outcome tracking won't be persisted
- **Workaround**: Events will be logged to console only

#### User Check-in Preferences
- ❌ checkin_preference field missing
- ❌ checkin_preference_updated_at field missing
- **Impact**: User preferences for quick vs full check-ins won't persist across sessions
- **Workaround**: Preferences stored in localStorage only

## Deployment Recommendation

### ✅ SAFE TO DEPLOY with the following caveats:

1. **Core Features Working**:
   - Enhanced daily check-ins with all evidence-based fields
   - PHQ-4 mental health assessments
   - Outcome predictions and metrics
   - Medication adherence tracking
   - Side effects monitoring

2. **Limited Features**:
   - Check-in preferences won't persist (uses localStorage)
   - A/B testing data won't be collected in Airtable
   - Analytics events will log to console instead of database

3. **No Breaking Changes**:
   - All existing functionality remains intact
   - Enhanced features gracefully degrade when fields are missing

## Required Actions for Full Functionality

1. **Add to Users table**:
   ```
   checkin_preference (Single Select: full_daily, quick_daily)
   checkin_preference_updated_at (Date/Time)
   ```

2. **Create FVMAnalytics table** as specified in the migration guide
