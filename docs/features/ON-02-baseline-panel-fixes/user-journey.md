# User Journey: Baseline Panel Fixes

## Affected User Personas
- **Primary**: New users going through fast onboarding (A/B test path)
- **Secondary**: Existing users who dismissed the panel

## Previous Journey (Broken)
1. User completes fast onboarding → Lands on dashboard
2. Baseline panel appears (expected)
3. User completes baseline information → Submits
4. Page reloads → **Panel appears again** ❌
5. User dismisses panel → Navigates to check-ins
6. User returns to dashboard → **Panel appears again** ❌
7. User clicks "Complete Profile" → Completes form
8. **Panel still appears** ❌

## Fixed Journey
1. User completes fast onboarding → Lands on dashboard
2. Baseline panel appears (expected)
3. User completes baseline information → Submits
4. Panel closes smoothly → Dashboard updates ✅
5. User navigates away and returns → No panel ✅
6. Dismissal is remembered across sessions ✅

## Critical User Feedback Addressed
- "I was once again greeted with the modal after completing full onboarding"
- "I created a new user, dismissed modal, tabbed to check ins, clicked Complete Profile, completed info, submitted, and was still presented with the full onboarding modal"

## State Management Flow
```
Initial State → Show Panel Decision → User Action → Update Context → Persist State
     ↓               ↓                     ↓              ↓              ↓
User Data      Check Conditions      Complete/Dismiss  updateUser()   localStorage
```

## Edge Cases Handled
1. **Fast refresh during development**: State preserved
2. **Multiple tabs open**: localStorage sync
3. **Network failures**: Graceful degradation
4. **Missing fields**: Proper null checks

## Friction Points Eliminated
- ❌ Repetitive modal appearances
- ❌ Lost form data on reload
- ❌ Confusion about completion status
- ❌ Navigation state loss
