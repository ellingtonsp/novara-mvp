# ON-02: Baseline Panel Fixes

## Overview
This feature addresses critical issues with the baseline panel (onboarding modal) that was inappropriately reappearing after users had already completed their profile setup. The fix ensures proper state management and prevents user frustration.

## Problem Statement
Users were experiencing the baseline panel reappearing in multiple scenarios:
1. After successfully completing onboarding
2. After dismissing the modal and navigating between views
3. After completing profile via the "Complete Profile" button
4. When returning to the dashboard after full onboarding

## Solution
Implemented a state-preserving update mechanism using React Context to update user data without page reloads, maintaining dismissal state and preventing the panel from reappearing inappropriately.

## Key Changes
1. Added `updateUser` function to AuthContext
2. Replaced `window.location.reload()` with context updates
3. Added dismissal state tracking
4. Fixed field mapping (primary_concern â†’ primary_need)

## Impact
- **User Experience**: Eliminated frustrating modal reappearances
- **Engagement**: Reduced drop-off during onboarding flow
- **Technical Debt**: Removed brittle page reload pattern

## Related Epic
- **Epic**: ON (Onboarding)
- **Story**: Improve onboarding completion rates
- **Priority**: High (blocking user flow)

## Success Metrics
- 0% of users see baseline panel after completion
- 100% dismissal persistence across navigation
- No page reloads during onboarding flow
