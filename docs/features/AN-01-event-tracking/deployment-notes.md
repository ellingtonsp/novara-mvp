```bash
# Verify staging is working correctly
# All tests passing in staging
# PostHog events appearing in staging project
# No critical issues identified

# Get user approval for production deployment
# Confirm all acceptance criteria met
```

## 🔍 Post-Deployment Validation

### **Environment Detection**
```bash
# Verify correct environment detection
# Browser console should show correct environment
# Check for: "🚀 AN-01 DEBUG: Current environment: [environment]"
```

### **Event Tracking**
```bash
# Test all four events
# 1. Signup event - Create new user account
# 2. Check-in event - Submit daily check-in
# 3. Insight viewed event - View insight card
# 4. Share action event - Share insight content

# Verify events in PostHog
# Check PostHog dashboard for event appearance
# Verify event payloads are correct
# Confirm environment field is correct
```

```bash
# Verify event timing
# Events should fire within 200ms
# No user experience degradation
# Bundle size impact acceptable

# Monitor performance
# Check browser dev tools Performance tab
# Monitor network requests to PostHog
# Verify no blocking operations
```

### **Error Handling**
```bash
# Test error scenarios
# 1. Network failure - Block PostHog API calls
# 2. Authentication failure - Use expired token
# 3. Validation failure - Submit invalid data

# Verify graceful degradation
# User experience unaffected by analytics failures
# Console shows appropriate error logs
# No user-facing errors
```

## 📊 Monitoring & Alerts

### **PostHog Monitoring**
```bash
# Monitor event delivery
# Check PostHog dashboard for event volume

```

## 🔒 Security & Privacy

### **Privacy Validation**
```bash
# Verify no PII in events
# Check event payloads for personal data
# Confirm only user_id used for identification
# Verify no email, name, or phone in events

# Test privacy compliance
# Verify DNT respect
# Check session recording disabled
# Confirm autocapture disabled
```

### **Security Validation**
