# Daily Check-In Questionnaire Redesign Proposal
## Enhanced Sentiment Capture & Data Triangulation

**Date:** 2025-07-25  
**Context:** CM-01 Positive-Reflection NLP & Dynamic Copy  
**Problem:** Current system only captures sentiment from struggling areas (confidence ≤4)  
**Goal:** Capture comprehensive journey sentiment for better long-term insights  

---

## 🚨 Current Limitation Analysis

### **The Problem:**
```javascript
// Current logic only shows text fields for low confidence
if (confidence_meds <= 4) { 
  // Show medication concern text field 
}
if (confidence_costs <= 4) { 
  // Show financial concern text field 
}
// Result: Confident users get NO free text input
```

### **What We're Missing:**
- ❌ **Positive developments**: "Insurance approved my coverage!"
- ❌ **Evolving concerns**: New worries that emerge as treatment progresses  
- ❌ **General reflections**: "Feeling ready for this next phase"
- ❌ **Celebration moments**: "Partner has been so supportive this week"
- ❌ **Complexity**: Mixed feelings about different aspects simultaneously

### **Impact on CM-01 Goals:**
- **Sentiment analysis** only sees struggles, not celebrations
- **Copy variants** can't respond to positive developments  
- **Long-term insights** miss emotional journey evolution
- **User feels unheard** when positive experiences aren't captured

---

## 🎯 Proposed New Structure

### **1. Universal Journey Reflection (Always Present)**
```javascript
{
  id: 'journey_reflection_today',
  type: 'text',
  question: 'How are you feeling about your journey today?',
  placeholder: 'Share anything on your mind - celebrations, worries, thoughts...',
  required: false,
  priority: 1,
  context: 'universal_sentiment',
  sentiment_target: true  // This field is primary for sentiment analysis
}
```

**Purpose:**
- ✅ **Always visible** regardless of confidence levels
- ✅ **General sentiment capture** not tied to specific dimensions
- ✅ **Open-ended** to catch evolving concerns and positive developments
- ✅ **Primary target** for sentiment analysis and copy variants

### **2. Confident Area Check-Ins (New Approach)**
```javascript
// Instead of only asking about struggles, check on positive areas too
if (confidence_meds >= 7) {
  {
    id: 'medication_confidence_momentum',
    type: 'text',
    question: `You're feeling confident about medications (${confidence_meds}/10). What's working well?`,
    placeholder: 'timing routine, side effects manageable, doctor support...',
    context: 'positive_reinforcement'
  }
}
```

### **3. Trend-Based Dynamic Questions**
```javascript
// Track trends over time, not just current struggles
if (hasDecreasingTrend('confidence_meds', 3)) {  // Last 3 check-ins
  {
    question: 'Your medication confidence has shifted recently. What changed?',
    context: 'trend_investigation'
  }
}

if (hasImprovingTrend('confidence_costs', 3)) {
  {
    question: 'Your financial confidence is improving! What helped?',
    context: 'positive_trend_capture'
  }
}
```

### **4. Dimension Balance Questions**
```javascript
// Understand how different areas interact
if (Math.abs(confidence_meds - confidence_costs) >= 4) {
  {
    question: 'You feel differently about medications vs costs. Tell us more?',
    context: 'dimension_balance'
  }
}
```

## 🔄 Enhanced Sentiment Triangulation

### **Current vs. Proposed Data Flow:**

#### **Current (Limited):**
```
User Input: Only struggle-focused text → Sentiment Analysis → Basic Copy Variant
```

#### **Proposed (Comprehensive):**
```
Multiple Inputs:
├── Universal Journey Reflection (primary sentiment)
├── Mood Selection (emotional state)  
├── Confidence Scores (self-efficacy across dimensions)
├── Trend-Based Questions (change detection)
└── Positive Reinforcement Captures (what's working)
     ↓
Advanced Triangulation Engine:
├── Sentiment Analysis (from universal reflection)
├── Confidence Pattern Analysis (across dimensions)
├── Mood-Sentiment Alignment Check
├── Trend Impact Assessment
└── Positive/Struggle Balance Evaluation
     ↓
Contextual Copy Variants:
├── Celebrates specific positive developments
├── Acknowledges struggles with nuanced support
├── Recognizes complex mixed emotions
├── Tracks personal growth over time
└── Provides tailored next-step suggestions
```

## 📊 Long-Term User Data Journey

### **Enhanced Data Collection:**
```javascript
DailyCheckin {
  // Universal (always collected)
  journey_reflection: "Primary sentiment capture",
  mood_selection: ["hopeful", "anxious"],
  confidence_today: 7,
  
  // Dimension-specific (dynamic based on user profile & trends)
  medication_confidence_today: 8,
  medication_momentum: "Routine is working well",  // NEW: positive capture
  
  financial_stress_today: 4,
  financial_concern_today: "Insurance deductible worries",
  
  // Meta-tracking (NEW)
  confidence_trend_3day: "improving",
  dimension_balance: "medication_high_financial_low",
  sentiment_complexity: "mixed_positive_dominant"
}
```

### **Insight Evolution Over Time:**
```javascript
Week 1: "Early anxiety about unknowns"
Week 3: "Growing confidence in medical team, financial stress emerging"  
Week 6: "Medication routine mastered, celebrating small wins"
Week 10: "Complex emotions as treatment approaches - ready but nervous"
```

## 🎨 Enhanced Copy Variant Examples

### **Current System (Limited):**
- Positive: "You're absolutely glowing today! ✨"
- Neutral: Generic support message
- Negative: Struggle-focused support

### **Proposed System (Contextual):**

#### **Mixed Emotions (Most Common in IVF):**
```
Sentiment: Positive + High Med Confidence + High Financial Stress
Response: "It's beautiful how confident you're feeling about your protocol while 
         also honestly acknowledging the financial stress. Both feelings are 
         completely valid and show you're approaching this thoughtfully."
```

#### **Positive Development Recognition:**
```
Sentiment: Positive + Improving Trend + Specific Success
Response: "Your growing confidence about [specific area] over the past few days 
         is so encouraging to see. What you said about [specific positive] 
         shows real progress in your journey."
```

#### **Struggle with Strength:**
```
Sentiment: Negative + High Overall Confidence + Specific Concern
Response: "Even with [specific worry] weighing on you today, your overall 
         strength in this journey shines through. Let's address this specific 
         concern while building on what's working."
```
