railway link --project novara-mvp --environment staging

# Link to production with full parameters  
railway link --project novara-mvp --environment production

# Link to specific service in staging
railway link --project novara-mvp --environment staging --service novara-staging
```

### **Deployment**
```bash

railway up --service novara-staging
```

## **‚ùå FORBIDDEN Commands (Require Manual Selection)**

railway service           # Lists services but requires selection
railway link             # Without parameters, requires manual selection
```
