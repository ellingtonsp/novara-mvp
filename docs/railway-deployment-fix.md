# Railway Deployment Fix - Root Cause Analysis & Solution

## üö® **Problem: "Could not find root directory: backend"**

### **Root Cause**
The Railway deployment was failing due to a **configuration conflict**:

1. **Dockerfile**: Copies `backend/` contents to `/app` and sets `WORKDIR /app`
2. **railway.json**: Had `"startCommand": "cd backend && node server.js"`
3. **Result**: Double `cd backend` causes "Could not find root directory: backend"

### **Why It Kept Breaking Daily**
- **Auto-deployments**: Used `railway.json` configuration (failed)
- **CLI deployments**: Used `cd backend && railway up` (worked)
- **Inconsistency**: Different deployment methods had different results

## ‚úÖ **Solution: CLI Deployment from Backend Directory**

### **1. Fixed Configuration**
```json
// railway.json - REMOVED conflicting cd backend
{
  "deploy": {
    "startCommand": "node server.js",  // ‚úÖ REMOVED cd backend
    "healthcheckPath": "/api/health",
    "healthcheckTimeout": 600
  }
}
```

### **2. MANDATORY Deployment Method**
**ONLY use this method for Railway deployments:**
```bash
cd backend && railway up
```

### **3. Why This Works**
- **Directory Context**: Railway CLI runs from backend directory where server.js exists
- **No Configuration Conflicts**: Avoids railway.json startCommand issues
- **Direct Control**: Bypasses Railway's auto-deployment system that fails
- **Consistent Results**: Same method works every time

## üö® **Forbidden Methods**
- ‚ùå `railway up` from project root
- ‚ùå Auto-deployments using railway.json startCommand
- ‚ùå Any method that doesn't use `cd backend && railway up`

## üìã **Railway Deployment Checklist**
- [ ] **ALWAYS use**: `cd backend && railway up`
- [ ] **NEVER use**: Auto-deployments or project root deployment
- [ ] **Verify Railway link**: `railway status` shows correct project/environment/service
- [ ] **Test health endpoint**: `curl -s https://novara-mvp-production.up.railway.app/api/health`
- [ ] **Check logs**: `railway logs` to confirm server started
- [ ] **Follow branch strategy**: Never commit directly to main

## üö® **Emergency Recovery**
If Railway deployment fails with "Could not find root directory: backend":
```bash
# 1. Check current status
railway status

# 2. Re-link if needed
railway link --project novara-mvp --environment production --service novara-main

# 3. Deploy using the ONLY method that works
cd backend && railway up

# 4. Verify deployment
curl -s https://novara-mvp-production.up.railway.app/api/health
```

## üéØ **Key Lessons Learned**
1. **Configuration Conflicts**: Dockerfile and railway.json can conflict
2. **CLI Method Works**: `cd backend && railway up` is the ONLY reliable method
3. **Auto-Deployments Fail**: railway.json startCommand causes "Could not find root directory: backend"
4. **Directory Context Matters**: Railway CLI must run from backend directory
5. **Branch Strategy Violations**: Direct commits to main are forbidden
6. **Emergency Recovery**: Always re-link and use CLI method for recovery

## ‚úÖ **Success Metrics**
- **Before**: Daily Railway deployment failures
- **After**: Consistent successful deployments using CLI method
- **Root Cause**: Eliminated configuration conflicts
- **Solution**: Standardized on CLI deployment from backend directory
