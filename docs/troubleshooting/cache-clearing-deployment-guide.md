# Cache Clearing Fix Deployment Guide

## Problem
iPhone users are experiencing cache issues where they see outdated content even after app updates. This is a common PWA issue where the service worker cache doesn't automatically update.

## Solution Implemented
1. **Version-based cache management** - Updated service worker to use versioned cache names
2. **Manual cache clearing** - Added "Clear Cache" button in mobile menu
3. **Automatic cache detection** - App checks for outdated caches on load
4. **Console cache clearing script** - Standalone script for manual cache clearing

## Files Modified
- `frontend/public/sw.js` - Updated cache version and improved cache management
- `frontend/src/utils/pwa.ts` - Added cache clearing functions
- `frontend/src/components/NovaraLanding.tsx` - Added cache clearing UI
- `frontend/src/App.tsx` - Added automatic cache checking
- `frontend/public/cache-clear.js` - Standalone cache clearing script

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Deploy to Staging First
```bash
# Follow the established DevOps plan
git checkout development
git add .
git commit -m "Add cache clearing functionality for iPhone PWA issues"
git push origin development

# Create PR to staging
./scripts/create-pr.sh development staging

# Deploy to staging
./scripts/deploy-staging.sh
```

### 2. Test on Staging
- [ ] Test cache clearing button on iPhone
- [ ] Verify automatic cache detection works
- [ ] Check console cache clearing script
- [ ] Test service worker updates

### 3. Deploy to Production
```bash
# After staging validation
git checkout staging
git merge development
git push origin staging

# Create PR to main
./scripts/create-pr.sh staging main

# Deploy to production
./scripts/deploy-production.sh
```

## User Instructions for Cache Issues

### For iPhone Users Experiencing Issues:

#### Option 1: Use the Clear Cache Button
1. Open the Novara app
2. Log in to your account
3. Tap the menu button (â˜°) in the top right

2. Remove cache clearing UI from `NovaraLanding.tsx`
3. Deploy hotfix to production
4. Investigate root cause

## Future Improvements
