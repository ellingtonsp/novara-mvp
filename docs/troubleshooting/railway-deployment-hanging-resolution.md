# Railway Deployment Hanging - Resolution Guide

## 🚨 Problem Summary

Railway deployments frequently hang during the build or deployment phase, causing:
- Indefinite waiting without completion
- Need to kill processes manually
- Deployment failures without clear error messages
- Production outages when hotfixes can't deploy
- **LOCAL DEVELOPMENT ALSO HANGS** with similar symptoms

## 🔍 Root Causes Identified

### 1. **Build Process Issues**
- Missing dependencies (e.g., `compression` module)
- Undefined variables (e.g., `performanceMonitoring` vs `performanceMiddleware`)
- Build script errors that cause silent failures
- **Port conflicts in local development**
- **SQLite database permission issues**

### 2. **Railway CLI Issues**
- Railway CLI can hang when network conditions are poor
- Multiple Railway processes can conflict
- Railway context not properly set before deployment
- **Interactive prompts that never resolve**
- **Authentication timeouts**

### 3. **Environment Issues**
- Environment variables not properly set
- Database configuration mismatches
- Network connectivity problems
- **File permission issues on macOS**
- **Node.js process conflicts**

## 🛠️ COMPREHENSIVE HANGING PREVENTION STRATEGY

### Local Development Hanging Prevention

#### 1. **Port Management Strategy**
```bash
# ALWAYS kill existing processes before starting
pkill -f nodemon
pkill -f "node server.js"
lsof -ti:9002 | xargs kill -9 2>/dev/null || true
lsof -ti:4200 | xargs kill -9 2>/dev/null || true

# Use stable ports with conflict detection
./scripts/start-dev-stable.sh  # Uses 9002, 4200 - conflict-free
```

#### 2. **Database Permission Fix**
```bash
# Fix SQLite database permissions
chmod 755 backend/data/
chmod 664 backend/data/novara-local.db*

# Recreate if corrupted
rm backend/data/novara-local.db*
# Will be recreated on next startup
```

#### 3. **Dependency Verification**
```bash
# Always verify dependencies before starting
cd backend && npm install
cd ../frontend && npm install

# Check for missing imports
grep -r "require.*not found" backend/ || echo "✅ All requires valid"
```

### Railway Deployment Hanging Prevention

#### 1. **Pre-deployment Validation (MANDATORY)**
```bash
# Step 1: Kill any existing Railway processes
pkill -f railway || true

# Step 2: Verify dependencies
cd backend && npm install
npm audit fix || echo "⚠️ Audit warnings present"

# Step 3: Test local build
NODE_ENV=production npm run build:check 2>/dev/null || echo "⚠️ Build check skipped"

# Step 4: Verify Railway context
railway status || railway link novara-mvp
railway environment staging
railway service novara-staging
```

#### 2. **Timeout-Protected Deployment**
```bash
# NEVER use railway up without timeout protection
timeout 180s railway up || {
    echo "🚨 Railway deployment timed out after 3 minutes"
    pkill -f railway
    railway status
    exit 1
}
```

#### 3. **Progressive Deployment Strategy**
```bash
# Step-by-step deployment with validation
echo "🚀 Phase 1: Context setup..."
railway status | grep -q "staging" || {
    echo "❌ Wrong environment, fixing..."
    railway environment staging
    railway service novara-staging
}

echo "🚀 Phase 2: Environment verification..."
railway variables | grep -q "appEOWvLjCn5c7Ght" || {
    echo "❌ Wrong database configuration"
    exit 1
}

echo "🚀 Phase 3: Deployment with timeout..."
timeout 300s railway up
```

## 🚨 EMERGENCY RECOVERY PROCEDURES

### When Railway CLI Hangs Completely
```bash
# Step 1: Nuclear option - kill all Railway processes
sudo pkill -f railway
sudo pkill -f "railway up"
sudo pkill -f "railway deploy"

# Step 2: Clear Railway cache
rm -rf ~/.railway 2>/dev/null || true

# Step 3: Re-authenticate and link
railway login
railway link novara-mvp
railway environment staging
railway service novara-staging

# Step 4: Try minimal deployment
echo "console.log('test')" > test.js
railway up --service novara-staging < /dev/null &
sleep 60
pkill -f railway
rm test.js
```

### When Local Development Hangs
```bash
# Step 1: Kill all Node.js processes
sudo pkill -f node
sudo pkill -f nodemon
sudo pkill -f vite

# Step 2: Clear port conflicts
for port in 3000 3001 3002 4200 9002; do
    lsof -ti:$port | xargs kill -9 2>/dev/null || true
done

# Step 3: Reset database
rm backend/data/novara-local.db*

# Step 4: Clean restart
./scripts/start-dev-stable.sh
```

## 📋 HANGING PREVENTION CHECKLIST

### Before Any Deployment
- [ ] Kill existing Railway processes: `pkill -f railway`
- [ ] Verify dependencies: `npm install` in both frontend/backend
- [ ] Check Railway context: `railway status`
- [ ] Verify database config: `railway variables | grep AIRTABLE_BASE_ID`
- [ ] Set aggressive timeout: Never exceed 5 minutes
- [ ] Have emergency stop ready: `pkill -f railway`

### Before Local Development
- [ ] Kill existing processes: `pkill -f nodemon`
- [ ] Clear port conflicts: `./scripts/kill-local-servers.sh`
- [ ] Verify database permissions: `ls -la backend/data/`
- [ ] Use stable ports: `./scripts/start-dev-stable.sh`

### During Operations
- [ ] Monitor for hanging (no output for >30 seconds)
- [ ] Use timeout commands for all Railway operations
- [ ] Have recovery procedures ready
- [ ] Document any new hanging scenarios

## 🎯 SUCCESS METRICS

- Railway deployments should complete within 3-4 minutes
- Local development should start within 30 seconds
- Zero hanging processes left running
- Clear error messages when failures occur
- Emergency recovery works within 60 seconds

## 📝 HANGING PATTERN DOCUMENTATION

### Common Hanging Patterns Observed:
1. **Railway CLI silent hang** - No output, no progress for >2 minutes
2. **Build process hang** - Stuck on dependency installation
3. **Database connection hang** - Timeout on Airtable/SQLite connection
4. **Port conflict hang** - Local server can't bind to port
5. **Permission hang** - SQLite database read-only errors
6. **Authentication hang** - Railway login/context issues

### Prevention Strategies:
- **Always use timeouts** (never unlimited waits)
- **Progressive validation** (test each step before proceeding)
- **Aggressive cleanup** (kill processes proactively)
- **Fallback procedures** (multiple retry strategies)
- **Environment isolation** (prevent conflicts between local/remote)

## 🔄 CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT

When new hanging patterns are discovered:
1. Document the exact symptoms
2. Identify the root cause
3. Add specific prevention strategy
4. Update scripts with new safeguards
5. Test prevention on next deployment
6. Share knowledge with team

This strategy should eliminate 95%+ of hanging scenarios in both Railway deployments and local development.
