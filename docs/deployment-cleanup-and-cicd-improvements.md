## 🚨 Critical Safety Rules Implemented

### Environment-Specific Commands
- **NEVER** use `vercel --prod` for staging deployments
- **ALWAYS** use `vercel --target staging` for staging
- **ALWAYS** verify environment before deploying
- **NEVER** bypass staging → production workflow

### Railway Context Management
- **ALWAYS** check `railway status` before operations
- **ALWAYS** switch to correct environment
- **ALWAYS** select correct service
- **NEVER** assume context is correct

### DevOps Workflow Enforcement
- Development → Staging → Production (NEVER skip)
- **ALWAYS** test in staging before production
- **ALWAYS** require explicit user approval for production
- **NEVER** make production changes without staging validation
