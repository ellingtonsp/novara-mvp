# Enhanced CI/CD Protocols for Minimizing Build Failure Alerts

**Last Updated:** July 24, 2025  
**Version:** 2.0  
**Environment:** Novara MVP

## 🎯 Mission Statement

Accelerate fertility patients' access to accurate insights, compassionate support, and effective treatments by delivering high-quality software rapidly and safely through robust CI/CD protocols that minimize build failures and deployment alerts.

## 🚨 Critical Deployment Rules

### Environment-Specific Commands
- **NEVER** use `vercel --prod` for staging deployments
- **ALWAYS** use `vercel --target staging` for staging deployments
- **ALWAYS** verify environment before deploying
- **NEVER** bypass staging → production workflow

### Railway Context Management
- **ALWAYS** check `railway status` before any Railway operations
- **ALWAYS** switch to correct environment: `railway environment staging`
- **ALWAYS** select correct service: `railway service novara-staging`
- **NEVER** assume Railway context is correct

### DevOps Workflow Enforcement
- Development → Staging → Production (NEVER skip stages)
- **ALWAYS** test on staging before production
- **ALWAYS** require explicit user approval for production changes
- **NEVER** make production changes without staging validation

## 🔧 Pre-Deployment Safety Checks

### Automated Validation Scripts
```bash
# Run comprehensive pre-deployment checks
npm run safety:check

# Validate environment configurations
npm run validate:environments

# Test deployment scripts syntax
./scripts/deployment-cleanup-and-testing.sh
```

### Manual Validation Checklist
- [ ] Current branch matches target environment
- [ ] Railway context is correct
- [ ] Environment variables are properly configured
- [ ] No uncommitted changes (or changes are intentional)
- [ ] Health checks pass
- [ ] Deployment scripts exist and are valid
- [ ] Monitoring tools are active
- [ ] **CRITICAL: Run local production build** (`cd frontend && npm run build`)
- [ ] **CRITICAL: Validate TypeScript compilation** (`tsc --noEmit`)
- [ ] **CRITICAL: Test files are production-ready** (no unused variables)

## 🧹 Deployment Cleanup Procedures

### Automated Cleanup
```bash
# Run automated cleanup (removes old logs, reports, corrupted modules)
./scripts/automated-cleanup.sh

# Comprehensive cleanup and testing
./scripts/deployment-cleanup-and-testing.sh
```

### Manual Cleanup Tasks
1. **Vercel Dashboard Cleanup:**
   - Remove failed deployments older than 24 hours
   - Archive successful deployments older than 7 days
   - Review deployment logs for patterns

2. **Railway Cleanup:**
   - Check for failed builds
   - Review service logs
   - Clean up unused resources

3. **Local Cleanup:**
   - Remove old test reports
   - Clean up log files
   - Rebuild corrupted node_modules

## 📊 Monitoring and Alerting

### Health Check Monitoring
```bash
# Comprehensive health check
npm run health-check

# Environment-specific health checks
npm run health-check:staging
npm run health-check:production

# Performance monitoring
npm run performance
```

### Deployment Tracking
```bash
# Track deployment status
npm run track:deployments

# Monitor platform health
npm run monitor:platforms
```

### Alert Thresholds
- **Build Failure Rate:** < 2%
- **Deployment Success Rate:** > 98%
- **Mean Time to Recovery:** < 60 minutes
- **Health Check Failure Rate:** < 1%

## 🛠️ CI/CD Protocol Testing

### Regular Testing Schedule
- **Daily:** Automated cleanup and health checks
- **Weekly:** Full protocol validation
- **Monthly:** Performance and security audits
- **Quarterly:** Architecture and tech stack reviews

### Testing Scripts
```bash
# Test CI/CD protocols
./scripts/deployment-cleanup-and-testing.sh

# Validate deployment scripts
bash -n scripts/deploy-staging.sh
bash -n scripts/deploy-production.sh

# Test monitoring systems
node scripts/environment-health-check.js
node scripts/simple-deployment-tracker.js
```

## 🔄 Deployment Workflow

### Staging Deployment
```bash
# 1. Pre-deployment checks
npm run safety:check

# 2. Deploy frontend to staging
cd frontend && vercel --target staging

# 3. Deploy backend to staging
railway environment staging
railway service novara-staging
railway up

# 4. Post-deployment validation
npm run health-check:staging
```

### Production Deployment
```bash
# 1. Verify staging validation
npm run health-check:staging

# 2. Get explicit user approval
# 3. Deploy frontend to production
cd frontend && vercel --prod

# 4. Deploy backend to production
railway environment production
railway service novara-main
railway up

# 5. Post-deployment validation
npm run health-check:production
```

## 🚨 Failure Response Procedures

### TypeScript Build Error Response (CRITICAL)
**Common Issue:** `'variableName' is declared but its value is never read.`

**Immediate Actions:**
1. **Check build logs** for specific TypeScript errors
2. **Run local build** to reproduce: `cd frontend && npm run build`
3. **Fix unused variables** in test files and source code
4. **Validate TypeScript compilation:** `tsc --noEmit`
5. **Test fix locally** before re-deploying

**Prevention:**
- Always run `npm run build` locally before deployment
- Use `tsc --noEmit` to catch compilation errors
- Remove unused imports and variables
- Test files must be production-ready

### Build Failure Response
1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Check deployment logs
   - Identify root cause
   - Rollback if necessary
   - Notify stakeholders

2. **Investigation:**
   - Review recent changes
   - Check environment configuration
   - Validate dependencies
   - Test locally

3. **Resolution:**
   - Fix the issue
   - Test in staging
   - Deploy fix
   - Document lessons learned

### Deployment Failure Response
1. **Assessment:**
   - Check service health
   - Review error logs
   - Identify affected components

2. **Recovery:**
   - Implement rollback procedure
   - Restore from backup if needed
   - Verify system stability

3. **Prevention:**
   - Update monitoring
   - Enhance testing
   - Improve deployment procedures
