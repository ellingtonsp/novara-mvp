# CM-01 Mixed Sentiment Enhancement - Testing Guide

## üéØ **Enhanced Mixed Sentiment Handling**

**Your Real Case**: Positive general outlook ("Feeling pretty good generally", hopeful mood) but critical medication concern (confidence: 2/10, "It's so confusing")

**Previous Issue**: System classified as purely "positive" and gave celebratory copy, missing the critical medication alarm.
