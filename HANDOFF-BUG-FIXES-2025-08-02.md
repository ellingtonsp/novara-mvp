# HANDOFF FOR NEXT CHAT - BUG FIX SEQUENCE
## Date: 2025-08-02

## Context
Continuing systematic bug fix approach from yesterday. Successfully completed Phase 2.2 and 2.3 today with user verification. Each fix was deployed with specific agent announcements per our deployment protocol.

## Session Summary
Today's session focused on medium-priority bugs affecting user experience:
- Fixed form scroll position reset issue (BUG-016)
- Cleaned up exposed variable names in insights (BUG-008)
- Corrected check-in count calculations (BUG-014)

All fixes used architectural solutions rather than quick patches, maintaining code quality and preventing future regressions.

## Completed (all properly documented):
### From Previous Sessions:
1. âœ… Phase 1.1: Fix BUG-002 - Profile loop issue (was false positive, documented in bug file)
2. âœ… Phase 1.2: Create UnifiedSlider component (fixes BUG-001, 003, 005 - all bug files updated)
3. âœ… Update onboarding sliders to use UnifiedSlider
4. âœ… Fix centered slider value display alignment issue
5. âœ… Fix duplicate value displays in all slider implementations
6. âœ… Fix BUG-009: EDC not saving check-in data
7. âœ… Phase 1.3: Fix BUG-004 - PHQ-4 flow correction (PHQ-4 removed from EDC, user story MH-01 created)
8. âœ… Phase 2.1: Fix check-in flow state (BUG-011, 012) (MEDIUM)
   - BUG-011: Fixed "It's been a week!" showing for new users
   - BUG-012: Fixed missing check-in preference toggle

### Today's Progress (2025-08-02):
9. âœ… Phase 2.2: Fix form navigation architecture (BUG-016) (MEDIUM)
   - Added useScrollToTop hook for consistent scroll behavior
   - Applied to all check-in forms (EDC, QDC, PHQ-4)
   - User verified fix working correctly
   
10. âœ… Phase 2.3: Fix data display consistency (BUG-014, 008) (MEDIUM)
    - BUG-008: Created customLabels system to replace raw variable names
    - BUG-014: Fixed check-in count logic to exclude onboarding entries
    - Both fixes verified by user in local environment

## Current Bug Status (from README.md):
- **Total**: 7 open, 25 resolved (32 total)
- **ðŸ”´ Large**: 0 open, 10 resolved âœ¨
- **ðŸŸ¡ Medium**: 3 open, 9 resolved
- **ðŸŸ¢ Small**: 4 open, 6 resolved

## Remaining Tasks (in priority order):
11. ðŸŸ¢ Phase 3.1: Fix interactive elements (BUG-015, 017, 018) (LOW)
    - BUG-015: Dashboard dots unresponsive
    - BUG-017: Tooltip disappears too quickly
    - BUG-018: Smart prep info icon nonfunctional
    
12. ðŸŸ¢ Phase 3.2: Fix form field improvements (BUG-006, 007) (LOW)
    - BUG-006: Missed doses prepopulate zero
    - BUG-007: Medication button color inconsistency
    
13. ðŸŸ¢ Phase 3.3: Fix content & feedback systems (BUG-013, 010) (LOW)
    - BUG-013: Insight feedback incorrect UI
    - BUG-010: PHQ-4 unclear progression UX

## Key Lessons Learned Today

### Form Scroll Reset Pattern
Created reusable `useScrollToTop` hook that:
- Triggers on mount and specific dependencies
- Works across all routing scenarios
- Prevents jarring mid-form position starts

### Variable Name Display Solution
Implemented `customLabels` mapping that:
- Centralizes all user-facing labels
- Provides graceful fallbacks
- Easily extensible for new variables
- Maintains consistency across insights

### Check-in Count Logic
Clarified that proper check-ins must:
- Have checkin_date set
- Not be onboarding entries (checkin_date != null)
- Include all check-in types (EDC, QDC, PHQ-4)

## Bug Documentation Process
When fixing a bug, ALWAYS:
1. Update the individual bug file (/docs/bugs/BUG-XXX-*.md):
   - Change Status from "ðŸ”„ Open" to "âœ… Resolved"
   - Add Resolution section with: Date, Solution, Technical Details, Files Modified
2. Update the main tracking file (/docs/bugs/README.md):
   - Update bug counts in the status table
   - Add summary to the appropriate resolved section
   - Keep the counts accurate

## Key Development Rules
- Never commit to main/staging branches
- Always test locally (ports: Frontend 4200, Backend 9002)
- Bugs aren't fixed until user confirms
- Always update bug documentation after fixes
- Prioritize architectural solutions over hardcoded fixes
- Use TodoWrite tool to track progress
- Run lint/typecheck after code changes
- Deploy each fix with agent-specific announcements

## PHQ-4 Scheduling Note
PHQ-4 has been removed from daily check-in flows. User story MH-01 has been created for implementing proper PHQ-4 scheduling as a separate feature. PHQ-4 should:
- Trigger once after onboarding
- Then run biweekly (or weekly for at-risk users)
- Have its own entry points (dashboard card, dedicated route)
- Never interrupt daily check-in flows

## Technical Patterns Established

### useScrollToTop Hook
```typescript
// Reusable hook for form scroll reset
const useScrollToTop = (dependencies?: any[]) => {
  useEffect(() => {
    window.scrollTo({ top: 0, behavior: 'instant' });
  }, dependencies || []);
};
```

### Custom Labels Pattern
```typescript
// Centralized label mapping
const customLabels: Record<string, string> = {
  medication_adherence: "Medication Adherence",
  mood_rating: "Mood",
  // ... extensible for all variables
};
```

## Next Recommended Task
Start with Phase 3.1: Fix interactive elements (BUG-015, 017, 018). These are all Small priority bugs related to UI responsiveness:
- /docs/bugs/BUG-015-dashboard-dots-unresponsive.md
- /docs/bugs/BUG-017-tooltip-disappears-too-quickly.md
- /docs/bugs/BUG-018-smart-prep-info-icon-nonfunctional.md

Consider batching these together as they're all interaction-related fixes.

## Local Development Command
```bash
./scripts/start-local.sh
```

## Final Note
Excellent progress today! All Large bugs are now resolved, and we've made significant headway on Medium bugs. The remaining 7 bugs are all Low priority, focusing on polish and minor UX improvements. The codebase is in a much healthier state with the architectural improvements made.

Good luck with the continued bug fixes!
