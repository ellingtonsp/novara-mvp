# 🚂 Railway Deployment Procedures Update Summary

## **Date**: July 26, 2025

## **Key Learnings from Today's Deployment**

1. **Railway CLI has evolved** - Some commands like `railway projects` no longer exist
2. **Manual selection is the enemy** - Any command that prompts for selection breaks automation
3. **Full parameters are mandatory** - Always specify project, environment, and service

---

## **✅ Updated Procedures**

### **Correct Railway Commands**
```bash
# ✅ CORRECT - No manual selection
railway link --project novara-mvp --environment staging
railway up

# ✅ BETTER - With service specification
railway link --project novara-mvp --environment staging --service novara-staging
railway up

# ❌ WRONG - Will prompt for manual selection
railway link
railway environment
railway service
```

### **Standard Deployment Flow**
1. **Use automated scripts** (preferred):
   ```bash
   ./scripts/deploy-staging-automated.sh
   ```

2. **Manual deployment** (emergency only):
   ```bash
   cd backend
   railway link --project novara-mvp --environment staging --service novara-staging
   railway up
   ```

## **📝 Documentation Updated**

1. **Created**: `docs/railway-cli-reference.md`
   - Comprehensive guide to Railway CLI commands
   - Clear distinction between correct and forbidden commands
   - Troubleshooting section

2. **Verified**: `.cursor/rules/deployment.mdc`
   - Already has correct procedures
   - Emphasizes no-interaction requirements

3. **Verified**: `docs/staging-deployment-checklist.md`
   - Already updated with correct commands
   - Automated script as primary method

4. **Verified**: `docs/railway-deployment-troubleshooting.md`
   - Already emphasizes no manual selection
   - Correct troubleshooting procedures

5. **Verified**: `scripts/deploy-staging-automated.sh`
   - Already uses full parameters
   - No interaction required

## **🧠 New Memory Created**

Added to assistant memory:
> "For Railway deployments, ALWAYS use full parameters to avoid manual selection: `railway link --project novara-mvp --environment staging` then `railway up`. NEVER use `railway environment`, `railway service`, or `railway link` without parameters as they require manual selection. Use automated scripts when possible: `./scripts/deploy-staging-automated.sh`."

---

## **🎯 Key Takeaways**

1. **Always use full parameters** in Railway commands
2. **Never use interactive commands** that require selection
3. **Prefer automated scripts** over manual commands
4. **Document specific project/environment/service names**
5. **Test deployment procedures regularly**

## **✅ Deployment Success**

Despite the Railway CLI challenges, we successfully:
- Fixed the check-in counting issue (Airtable query formulas)
- Deployed CM-01 daily check-in handling changes to staging
- Updated all documentation to reflect correct procedures
- Created comprehensive Railway CLI reference

**Current Staging Status**: 
- URL: https://novara-staging-staging.up.railway.app
- Environment: staging
- Check-in counting: WORKING ✅
- CM-01 features: DEPLOYED ✅
