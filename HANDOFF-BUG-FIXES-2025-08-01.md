## Current Bug Status
- **Total Bugs**: 19 documented
- **Resolved**: 12 (BUG-001, 002, 003, 004, 005, 007, 008, 009, 011, 012, 014, 019)
- **Open**: 7
- **Next Priority**: BUG-010 (PHQ-4 UX) and BUG-013 (insight feedback UI)

## Remaining Tasks for Next Session

### High Priority (Phase 3.3 - Continue)
1. **BUG-010**: PHQ-4 Unclear Progression UX
   - Users confused about question flow
   - Need clearer progress indicators
   - Consider numbered questions or progress bar

2. **BUG-013**: Insight Feedback Incorrect UI
   - Thumbs up/down icons not displaying properly
   - Need to implement proper feedback collection mechanism

### Medium Priority (Phase 4)
- **BUG-016**: Form scroll position not resetting
- **BUG-017**: Tooltip display duration too short
- **BUG-015**: Dashboard dots unresponsive

### Lower Priority
- **BUG-006**: Missed doses prepopulate with zero
- **BUG-018**: Smart prep info icon nonfunctional

## Bug Documentation Process
When fixing a bug, ALWAYS:
1. Update the individual bug file (/docs/bugs/BUG-XXX-*.md):
   - Change Status from "ðŸ”„ Open" to "âœ… Resolved"
   - Add Resolution section with: Date, Solution, Technical Details, Files Modified
2. Update the main tracking file (/docs/bugs/README.md):
   - Update bug counts in the status table
   - Add summary to the appropriate resolved section
   - Keep the counts accurate

## Key Development Rules
- Never commit to main/staging branches
- Always test locally (ports: Frontend 4200, Backend 9002)
- Bugs aren't fixed until user confirms
- Always update bug documentation after fixes
- Prioritize architectural solutions over hardcoded fixes
- Use TodoWrite tool to track progress
- Run lint/typecheck after code changes

## Key Technical Patterns Established

### 1. Slider Component Pattern
- Created UnifiedSlider component for consistent behavior
- Flex-based CSS for proper handle centering
- Touch event handling for mobile responsiveness

### 2. API Integration Pattern
- Always use backend APIs, never localStorage for critical data
- Proper error handling and validation
- Consistent response patterns

### 3. Time Display Pattern
- Use absolute timestamps instead of relative time
- Format: "Dec 1, 2025, 2:30 PM"
- Improves clarity for users

### 4. Form Data Persistence
- EDC form now properly saves to database
- All fields mapped correctly in backend
- Validation ensures data integrity

## Important Context for Next Session

### Testing Approach
- Always create test scripts before implementing fixes
- Verify fixes both via API and UI testing
- Document all fixes in bug tracking files

### Database Considerations
- EDC fields are properly mapped in backend
- All check-in data flows through PostgreSQL
- No localStorage usage for persistent data

### PHQ-4 Scheduling Note
PHQ-4 has been removed from daily check-in flows. User story MH-01 created for proper scheduling:
- Trigger once after onboarding
- Then run biweekly (or weekly for at-risk users)
- Have its own entry points (dashboard card, dedicated route)
- Never interrupt daily check-in flows

### Port Configuration
- Frontend: 4200 (stable)
- Backend: 9002 (stable)
- Never use port 3000

### Git Workflow
- All work on `develop` branch
- Feature branches format: `feature/bug-fixes-phase-X`
- PR target: `develop` branch

## Next Steps
1. Start with BUG-010 (PHQ-4 flow improvements)
2. Then tackle BUG-013 (insight feedback UI)
3. Continue through remaining bugs by priority
4. Update bug documentation after each fix

## Local Development Command
```bash
./scripts/start-local.sh
# Frontend: http://localhost:4200
# Backend: http://localhost:9002
```

## Notes
- User prefers script-based testing before manual UAT
- Documentation updates can be fast-tracked via docs-only commits
- Always verify bug fixes in local environment before marking resolved
- Today's focus was on data persistence and UI consistency fixes
