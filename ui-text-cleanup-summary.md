# UI Text Cleanup - Remove A/B Test References

## ðŸŽ¯ **User Feedback**
> "I do want to get rid of the A/B test text on the fast sign up modal entirely. Users shouldn't feel like they're being served a 'different' experience"

## âœ… **Changes Applied**

### **OnboardingFast.tsx**
```diff
- <span>Quick setup â€¢ A/B test path</span>
+ <span>Quick setup</span>
```

### **FastOnboarding.tsx**
```diff
- <span>Quick setup â€¢ A/B test path</span>
+ <span>Quick setup</span>
```

## ðŸŽ¨ **UI Improvement**

### **Before:**
- "Quick setup â€¢ A/B test path"
- Made users feel like test subjects
- Exposed technical implementation details

### **After:**
- "Quick setup"
- Clean, user-friendly text
- Focuses on the benefit (quick setup) not the method (A/B test)

## ðŸ§ª **Technical Details**

The A/B test functionality remains fully intact:
- âœ… Environment variable forcing still works (`VITE_FORCE_ONBOARDING_PATH=test`)
- âœ… PostHog feature flags still work
- âœ… Analytics tracking still works
- âœ… Conditional rendering still works
- âœ… Baseline completion flow still works

**Only the user-facing text was cleaned up** - no functional changes.

## ðŸš€ **Result**

Users now see a clean "Quick setup" message that:
- Focuses on the value proposition
- Doesn't make them feel like test subjects
- Maintains professional user experience
- Hides technical implementation details

Perfect example of **user-first design** - the technical complexity is hidden while the user benefit is highlighted.
