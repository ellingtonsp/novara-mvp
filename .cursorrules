# Cursor AI Rules for Novara MVP

> **Mission Statement:** Accelerate fertility patients' access to accurate insights, compassionate support, and effective treatments by delivering high-quality software rapidly and safely.

> **Guiding Principles:**
> 1. **Patient-First** – Every decision and line of code must ultimately benefit patients.
> 2. **Velocity × Quality** – Ship quickly **and** safely; speed is pointless without reliability.
> 3. **Documentation as Leverage** – Clear docs shorten onboarding and unlock autonomy.
> 4. **Automation over Repetition** – Script anything done twice; humans focus on judgement.
> 5. **Secure & Private by Default** – Patient data protection is non-negotiable.
> 6. **Continuous Learning** – Treat failures as feedback loops for improvement.

> **Success Metrics (tracked quarterly):**
> • Median lead-time from PR merge → patient-visible change ≤ **2 days**
> • Staging ↔ Production defect escape rate < **2 %**
> • Mean Time-to-Detect (MTTD) critical issues < **30 min**
> • Mean Time-to-Restore (MTTR) production < **60 min**
> • Documentation coverage of new features **100 %**

# Cursor AI Rules for Novara MVP
# This file helps maintain critical context across AI sessions

## 🚨 CRITICAL DEPLOYMENT RULES

### Environment-Specific Commands
- NEVER use `vercel --prod` for staging deployments
- ALWAYS use `vercel --target staging` or staging-specific commands
- ALWAYS verify environment before deploying
- NEVER bypass staging → production workflow

### Railway Context Management
- ALWAYS check `railway status` before any Railway operations
- ALWAYS switch to correct environment: `railway environment staging`
- ALWAYS select correct service: `railway service novara-staging`
- NEVER assume Railway context is correct
- **CRITICAL**: Before `railway up`, verify we're in staging environment and novara-staging service
- **CRITICAL**: If `railway link` is needed, select "novara-mvp" project, NOT any other project
- **CRITICAL**: After linking, immediately run `railway environment staging` and `railway service novara-staging`
- **CRITICAL**: Never run `railway up` without confirming environment and service context

### DevOps Workflow Enforcement
- Development → Staging → Production (NEVER skip stages)
- ALWAYS test on staging before production
- ALWAYS require explicit user approval for production changes
- NEVER make production changes without staging validation

## 🔧 Technical Context

### Current Environment URLs
- **Staging Frontend**: https://novara-bd6xsx1ru-novara-fertility.vercel.app
- **Staging Backend**: https://novara-staging-staging.up.railway.app
- **Production Frontend**: https://novara-mvp.vercel.app
- **Production Backend**: https://novara-mvp-production.up.railway.app

### Railway Project Structure
- **Project**: novara-mvp
- **Staging Environment**: staging
- **Staging Service**: novara-staging
- **Production Environment**: production
- **Production Service**: novara-main

### Deployment Commands
```bash
# Staging Frontend
cd frontend && vercel --target staging

# Staging Backend
railway status  # VERIFY: Project=novara-mvp, Environment=staging, Service=novara-staging
railway environment staging
railway service novara-staging
railway up

# Production (ONLY after staging validation)
cd frontend && vercel --prod
railway status  # VERIFY: Project=novara-mvp, Environment=production, Service=novara-main
railway environment production
railway service novara-main
railway up
```

## 🚨 Safety Checks

### Before Any Deployment
1. Check current branch: `git branch`
2. Check Railway context: `railway status`
3. Verify environment variables are correct
4. Confirm user approval for production changes
5. **CRITICAL**: Verify Railway project is "novara-mvp" and service is correct for environment
6. **CRITICAL**: For staging: Environment=staging, Service=novara-staging
7. **CRITICAL**: For production: Environment=production, Service=novara-main

### Before Any Code Changes
1. **Understand the goal** - what problem are we solving?
2. **Check existing solutions** - is this already implemented elsewhere?
3. **Review related documentation** - understand current patterns
4. **Assess impact** - what components will be affected?
5. **Plan rollback** - how can we undo this if needed?
6. **Validate approach** - is this the best solution for the problem?
7. **Check roadmap alignment** - does this work support current sprint goals?
8. **Reference roadmap context** - which epic/story does this work map to?

### Context Verification Commands
```bash
# Verify Railway context
railway status
railway domain

# Verify Vercel context
vercel ls

# Verify environment
echo $NODE_ENV

# CRITICAL: Pre-deployment Railway verification
railway status | grep -E "(Environment|Service)" && echo "✅ Railway context verified"
```

## 📋 Session Start Checklist

When starting a new session, ALWAYS:
1. Check current working directory
2. Verify Railway environment and service
3. Confirm which environment we're working with
4. Review recent deployment history
5. Ask user for explicit confirmation before any production changes
6. **Assess current context** - what are we working on and what's the goal?
7. **Check for active issues** - any ongoing problems or recent changes?
8. **Validate assumptions** - confirm understanding of current state
9. **Review roadmap alignment** - check `docs/roadmaps/Novara Product Roadmap.md` for strategic context
10. **Map work to roadmap** - identify which epic/story the current work supports

- **Validate user journey**: Ensure changes don't break documented user flows
- **Cross-reference dependencies**: Check all related feature documentation

### Systematic Problem Resolution
- **Start with the simplest explanation** - check obvious issues first
- **Gather complete context** before proposing solutions
- **Test assumptions** - don't assume the problem is where it appears to be
- **Provide multiple diagnostic approaches** - different ways to verify the issue
- **Document the resolution** - add to troubleshooting guides for future reference

### Common Issues & Solutions

### Environment-Specific Debugging

#### Railway Context Troubleshooting
```bash
# If "Project not found" error occurs:
railway link  # Select "novara-mvp" project
railway environment staging  # Set staging environment
railway service novara-staging  # Set staging service
railway status  # Verify context before deployment

# If wrong environment detected:
railway environment staging  # Force staging environment
railway service novara-staging  # Force staging service
railway up  # Deploy to correct environment

# Pre-deployment verification checklist:
# ✅ Project: novara-mvp
# ✅ Environment: staging (for staging deployment)
# ✅ Service: novara-staging (for staging deployment)
# ✅ Branch: staging (for staging deployment)
```

## 📊 MONITORING & OBSERVABILITY

### Health Checks
- **Environment Health**: `npm run health-check`
- **Schema Validation**: `npm run validate-schema-comprehensive`
- **Performance Monitoring**: `npm run performance`
- **Deployment Tracking**: `npm run track:deployments`
- **📖 Monitoring Guide**: `docs/deployment-monitoring-guide.md` - Comprehensive monitoring setup
- **📖 Railway Health**: `docs/railway-health-check-guide.md` - Railway-specific health monitoring

### Key Metrics to Monitor
- API response times
- Authentication success rates
- Database connection health
- Deployment success rates
- Error rates by environment

### Alerting
- Railway service failures
- Vercel deployment failures
- High error rates
- Performance degradation

## 🔐 SECURITY & BEST PRACTICES

### Authentication
- JWT tokens with 90-day expiration
- Automatic token refresh (1 hour before expiry)
- Secure token storage in browser
- Automatic logout on refresh failure
- **📖 Detailed Guide**: `docs/authentication-improvements.md` - Complete token management system documentation

### Environment Variables
- NEVER commit secrets to git
- Use environment-specific .env files
- Validate environment configuration before deployment
- Rotate secrets regularly
- **NEVER attempt to modify .env files directly** - user handles all .env file changes manually
- **ALWAYS provide exact file contents** when .env changes are needed
- **ALWAYS update all .env.[environment].example files** (development, staging, production) whenever any environment variable is added, changed, or removed—including all Airtable, analytics, and third-party keys. Double-check Airtable keys for continuity and completeness in every update. If the actual Airtable API key and base ID are known, always use the real values in all example files—never leave them blank or as placeholders if the real values are available.
